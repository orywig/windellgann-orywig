                                      <font color = blue>  "Blessed Are The Persecuted"</font color = blue>
                                                   Matthew 5:10-12

INTRODUCTION  

I.   Society has always persecuted its best and prosecuted
     its worst citizens, for refusing to conform to the middle
     of the road.

II.  There is unceasing conflict between good and evil, right
     and wrong, truth and error raging on earth, and
     frequently in our hearts.

III.  The eighth beatitude reminds us that being a Christian
      in the sinful world will inevitably cost and bring
      tribulation (John 16:33).

DISCUSSION  

I.   WHAT IT MEANS TO BE REPROACHED AND/OR
     PERSECUTED.

    A.   Reproach means a cause or occasion of blame,
          discredit or disgrace; the act or action of reproaching
          or disgracing; an expression of rebuke or
          disapproval.  To reproach another person means to
          speak abusively, to censure, rebuke revile or
          upbraid.  It may include false statements invented
          and told because of prejudice and/or malice which
          led those who invent them that nothing is too evil to
          believe/tell against the object of their malice.

    B.   To persecute means "to harass in a manner
          designed to injure, grieve, or afflict; specif: To cause
          to suffer because of belief.  To annoy with persistent
          or urgent approaches (as attacks, pleas, or
          importunities): PESTER." --Webster's New Collegiate
          Dictionary, p. 848.

         1.   To persecute means to vex, or oppress; torment
               or torture.
         2.   "The continued infliction of unjust pain or
               punishment; especially, a period of ill treatment
               and opposition on account of religious beliefs; the
               state of being unjustly treated, repeated repeated
               injury of any kind"-- F.L. Cox, Sermon Notes on
               the Sermon on the Mount, 1955, p. 31.

II.  WHAT ARE ITS CAUSES?

    A.   Intolerance and prejudice.  The righteous person is
          different and has no fellowship with the unfruitful
          works of darkness. (Ephesians 5:11); hence, this
          causes a feeling of resentment in the heart of the
          wicked (John 15:19).

    B.   Pride.  A Christian, by his very manner of life, is a
          constant rebuke to sinners (Hebrews 11:7b).  Some of
          them he wins; some he offends.  "He makes the
          worthless and self-centered uncomfortable." "Pride
          wounded writhes in pain:" Herod and John the
          Baptist (Matthew 14:1ff; Mark 6:24-28).  Elijah and
          the widow: "Are you come to call my sin to my
          remembrance?" (I Kings 17:18).

    C.   Envy or Jealousy.  Sinners as a rule do not rejoice
          when godly people in the same line are favored above
          them (Genesis 4:1-9).

    D.   Selfishness.  The genuine, vital Christian must often
          work for that which works against the profits of
          vested interests (Acts 16:16-23; 19:23ff; John 2:13-17).

    E.   The very aggressiveness of a Christian in
          carrying out God's will (John 14:6; Jude 3; 2
          Timothy 3:12).

         1.   Living goodness provokes opposition by those
               unlike Jesus--the ungodly, sensuous, profane; etc. 
               Christianity is a warfare (2 Corinthians 10:3-5;
               Ephesians 6:12; 1 Timothy 6:12).
         2.   Jesus said, He who loves darkness hates the light
               which exposes his evil works (John 3:19-21; Luke
               6:22-26: "Woe unto you when all men shall
               speak well of you! ...."
         3.   Although persecution is inevitable to him who is
               determined to live a Christian life (2 Timothy
               3:12), this does not mean that all people
               universally will hate or harm the Christian
               (2 Corinthians 4:2; 1 Peter 2:11,12; Acts 2:47).

III.   IN WHAT FORMS DOES PERSECUTION COME?

    A.   Material or physical loss or injury: By hand, fist,
          sword or flame.

          1.   Jesus; Stephen; Paul; Fox's Book of Martyrs; etc.
          2.   See also Hebrews 11:34.

    B.   By tongue or pen:  Verbal or written abuse or
          reproach.

         1.   Most persecution in our land has shifted from
               scaffold, stake and whipping post to classroom,
               gym, office and shop (Matthew 5:11).
         2.   It may come in the form of ridicule, slander,
               derision, scoffing, sport/rejection (Luke 6:22).
         3.   Jesus was accused of being a friend of publicans
               and sinners, a glutton, winebibber, mad, in league
               with Satan, etc., to discredit and destroy his
               influence and name (John 15:18,19).
    C.   See 20th Century Christian, 8/67, p. 33, Paden;
          McCord, Happiness Guaranteed, p.58.

IV.  HOW SHOULD WE RESPOND?  WHAT IS THE RIGHT
      ATTITUDE TOWARD PERSECUTION?
 
   A.   We must avoid unchristian response, such as
          whining/self-pity.

         1.   Do not yield to the temptation to complain, to
               whine, to succumb to self-pity.  Decide to win, not
               lose.  Becoming full of self pity instead of faith in
               Christ guarantees defeat and loss (Colossians
               1:27).
         2.   There is great danger in allowing a persecution
               complex to develop:  This allows one's
               misfortunes to become the champion of his life,
               rather than his faith in the Lord and worthy
               achievement through Jesus Christ our Lord to be
               the champion (Romans 8:37).
         3.   Do not yield to the temptation to take vengeance
               (Romans 12:17-19).
         4.   Do not become so discouraged that you give up
               the fight for right, saying, "What's the use?" (Mark
               4:16,17; 1 Corinthians 10:13).

     B.  We must adopt and follow the Christian response
          and attitude.

          1.  "Arm ye yourselves:"  "Forasmuch then as
               Christ suffered in the flesh, arm ye yourself
               also with the same mind; for he that hath
               suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;  that
               ye should no longer live the rest of your time
               in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will
               of God"  (1 Peter 4:1,2).
          2.  Bless/pray for your persecutors:  Do not curse,
               censure, revile, slander or speak evil against your
               tormentors (Romans 12:14; Matthew 5:43-45).
          3.  "Rejoice and be exceeding glad:"  "Leap for
               joy;"  "Let me congratulate you; "  "Be of good
               cheer;"  for two reasons.
               a.  A big reward awaits you:  "Great is your
                    reward in heaven" compare Revelation 3:21.
               b.  You are in wonderful company:  "For so
                    persecuted the prophets that were before
                    you."  You are now in the company of Abel,
                    Isaiah, Daniel, Stephen, Jesus, the apostles,
                    and a multitude of other righteous souls.
          4.  Bear patiently:  Return good for evil (1 Peter
               2:21-24; Romans 12:21).
               a.  Be fearless, settled and strong in the Lord: 
                    Follow Jesus, Paul and others like them (1
                    Corinthians 15:58; 16:13; 11:1).
               b.  "Wait for Jehovah:  Be strong, and let thy
                    heart take courage; Yea, wait thou for
                    Jehovah"  (Psalm 27:14: Isaiah 40:31; 41:9-11). 
                    "The tide will come in:"  "No person ever really
                    lives until he has found something worth dying
                    for.  You can never really possess the
                    Kingdom of God until the cause of God become
                    more important than you own life" -- Allen,
                    God's Psychiatry, p. 158.
          5.  Remain firm for the right:  John 12:23, 27, 28;
               17:5; Hebrews 12:2.
               a.   Stay in the struggle for right, in the stream of
                     life.
               b.   Keep on going:  Never give up!  Right will
                     prevail!  (1 Corinthian 10:13).
          6.   Remember that it is better to suffer for well-doing than 
                be praised or to suffer for evil doing
                (1Peter 2:20-25; 3:17, 18; 4:14-16).  Boyce, Power to
                Become, p. 43-46.

V.   BLESSINGS DERIVED FROM PERSECUTION

     A.   Strength.  Though being a Christian costs, it is the
           pathway to growth in compassion, steadfastness,
           approvedness and hope (Romans 5:1-5).

          1.   Although the trial or testing of faith is seldom
                pleasant from the human viewpoint, the proving
                of faith works patience, and it develops and
                reveals stronger, Christian character which
                includes greater trust in God and dependence
                upon Him  (James 1:2-4).
          2.   That is how we learn and grow in the grace that
                is in Christ (Luke 21:12,13; 2 Timothy 2:1; 2 Peter
                3:1-18).

     B.   Purity:  refining power (1 Peter 1:6-9).  "When  he
           hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold"  (Job 23:10-12).

     C.   Opportunities increase:  Larger usefulness. 
           Opportunities to glorify God and exalt Christ
           increase (Philippians 1:12; Acts 8:4; 1 Peter 3:16).

     D.   Concern of Christ and angels:  Matthew 5:10-12;
           Hebrews 1:14.

     E.   Final blessings:  Crown, eternal life:  A great
           reward in proportion to, yet much greater than,
           the sacrifice (2 Timothy 4:6-8; Matthew 5:12; Cf.
           Romans 8:18; 2 Corinthians 4:17,18).  Yet this
           promise is not to him who avoids, despises or merely
           observes the contest, whining "they criticize me,"
           etc., etc., when the going gets tough, the sun is hot,
           or the battle is crucial.

VI.  TO PARTAKE OF CHRIST'S SUFFERINGS HERE
      IS TO SHARE HIS GLORY WHEN HE COMES  (1
      Peter 4:12, 13; Romans 8:17,18).

VII. WE ARE "MORE THAN CONQUERORS THROUGH
      HIM" BECAUSE "ALL THINGS WORK TOGETHER
      FOR GOOD TO THEM THAT LOVE GOD, EVEN TO
      THEM THAT ARE CALLED ACCORDING TO HIS
      PURPOSE"  (Romans 8:28, 33-39).

                                                                   <I>    --Charles E. Crouch</I>
