INTRODUCTION  

I.   Salt has been a mineral of high value from the beginning, an essential
      to health: "Body cells must have salt in order to live and work." World
      Book Encyclopedia estimates "more than 14,000 uses for salt;" but
      less than 5% of the 22 million tons produced annually in the USA is
      for use in food.

II.  WHO ARE "THE SALT OF THE EARTH"?  The poor in spirit, they
      that mourn, the meek, they that hunger and thirst after
      righteousness, the merciful, the pure in heart, the peacemakers, who
      have entered God's kingdom and are willing to be persecuted and
      suffer for righteousness' sake, because of their calling, nature and
      relationship to God.

III.  But since all may become disciples of the Lord and citizens of his
      kingdom, he is speaking to all who will.

IV.  HE SPEAKS OF OUR PRIVILEGES, POSSIBILITIES AND OUR
      RESPONSIBILITIES.

     A.   As a statement of fact, it becomes the highest of compliments to
           any person, a tremendous encouragement to those who suffer
           unjustly for Christ's sake, and a clear and powerful call to
           service.

     B.   It thus speaks of our hope in Christ, and becomes a summary of
           all our duties in him.

DISCUSSION - 

I.     THE NATURE AND VALUE OF SALT: 
               LITERAL AND SPIRITUAL

     A.   Literal salt is very distinctive and important.

          1.   As a negative function, it is a saving power:  It purifies and
                preserves from impurity and prevents decay and corruption. 
                It is therefore one of the indispensable things, an absolute
                necessity.

          2.   As a positive function, it is a seasoning power. It seasons
                when it makes direct contact and "strikes in."  A child
                defined it as "that which makes potatoes no good without." 
                Thomas illustration:  A king asked three daughters how
                much they loved him:  Two said "Better than all the gold and
                silver in the world."  The third one said, "Better than salt." --
                Sermon on the Mount, p.22.

          3.   Can also destroy when perverted and used unwisely.

     B.   Spiritual salt is also extremely important and enormous in value.

          1.   Christian character is very distinctive and a wonderful force
                in the world that cannot be ignored.  The kingdom of God and
                heaven, the church, is an essential and indispensable thing:
                Though often criticized, it is one of the necessities of life.

          2.   It is an incomparable and mighty force in teaching and
                leading others to Christ, doing more to preserve the earth
                from decay than all other institutions (John 6:44,45; I Tim.
                4:16; Eph.1:15-23).

          3.   It is the foe of impurity, decay, corruption and rottenness:  It
                is a unique negative and preventative.  It keeps character
                pure, sound, godly and saintly; and is a safeguard of the
                world (Gen. 18:22-33).

          4.   It is also very positive, giving improved flavor and taste to
                whatever it touches.

II.  WHERE IS THE SPHERE OF OUR INFLUENCE?

     A.   Not in heaven, yesterday or in some far off tomorrow.

     B.   God gives us wonderful and unparalleled opportunities here and
           now.

          1.   In our homes:  "What is in your (salt) bucket"?

          2.   In the church:  Upon our peers, those we teach and
                influence?

          3.   In our community:  In all walks of life, in all we say and do
                around the earth (Acts 8:1-4; 1 Cor.10:31-33)?

     C.   When?  "Now today"  (2 Cor. 6:2; James 4:13-15; Hebrews 3:7-19).

III . HOW?  SOME WAG SAID, "MOST CHRISTIANS ARE ON A
      SALT-FREE DIET."  HOW SAD!

     A.   By character:  By being something distinctive it is our duty to
           be salt Mark 9:50).

          1.   Disciples of Christ are like him, not half-hearted or
                lukewarm.

          2.   He did not say "scatter salt," but "you are the salt of the
                earth."

          3.   By life commitment and loyalty to Jesus, his truth and values
                (Matt. 5:112; Luke 14:26; 2 Peter 1:5-11).

     B.   By contact:  By doing something distinctive as followers of
           Jesus:  Penetration;  we have a duty to be salt:  The basic
           active ingredient:  Heb. 4:12.

          1.   By being in contact with those whom we are to salt.
 
         2.   By going into the stream of life:  getting involved (Matt. 9:10-13). 
               By losing self in service to God as the salt of the earth
                (Matt. 16:25; 2 Cor. 12:15).

          3.   No monastic life is taught here:  "Salt in a box" saves and
                seasons nothing.  If all Christians remain "in one lump," and
                send out no personal workers or missionaries, hold no
                meetings, do no broadcasting or speaking for Christ and his
                truth, and turn the printed pages and mass media over to the
                forces of evil, what will happen to us and the lost world in
                view of Mark 16:15-16, and Matthew 28:18-20?

     C.   Five powerful/wonderful ways to be salt:  1 Timothy 4:12.

          1.   "In word" (Col.4:6; Psalm 19:14; Matt.12:34,37; Gal.4:19;
                2:20).  Do yours encourage and comfort?

          2.   "In manner of life" (Phil.1:27; 2 Cor.5:15,17). Is yours
                worthy?

          3.   "In love"  (John 13:35; 14:23; Romans 12:17-21; 1 Cor. 16:14;
                Eph. 4:15).

          4.   "In faith"  (1 Cor.16:13; 15:58; Eph. 4:14,15; 1 Thes. 2:13; Gal.
                5:6; Jude 3).

          5.   "In purity" (Matt.5:8; 1 Cor. 13:16; 1 Thes. 5:21-22).

IV.  BIBLE EXAMPLES:  THE POWER OF INFLUENCE, BOTH
      GODLY AND UNGODLY, IS PROFOUND AND FAR-REACHING.

     A.   These were NOT "the salt of the earth" (Gen. 6:5).

          1.   Lot's wife, in a time of great immorality and perversion: 
                Jesus said "remember" her (Luke 17:32).

          2.   Nadab and Abihu:  In a position of high privilege, trust,
                responsibility and opportunity, they wasted it and destroyed
                themselves  (Leviticus 10:1-3).

          3.   Ananias and Saphira:  In a time of great need and grand
                opportunity, they blew it.  Selfishness and deceit filled and
                marked the end of their lives:  like many, willing to make a
                donation, but not give heart/life (Acts 5).  Unlike Barnabas
                whose gift marked the beginning of great life/service to our
                Master (Acts 4:36).

          4.   These all had influence, but not the right kind.

     B.   These were "the salt of the earth."

          1.   Abraham:  "And be thou a blessing" (Genesis 12:2).  He was
                (Romans 4:1-22).

          2.   Joseph:  One of God's best, greatest and most Christlike men
                (Genesis 37-50).

          3.   Moses:  One of God's most monumental men.

          4.   The Jewish maiden who had such enormous influence on
                Naaman the Syrian leper (Luke 5:27; 2 Kings 5).

          5.   Barnabas; Paul; Lois; Eunice; Timothy (Acts 13; Phil.2:19,20).

          6.   Mary the mother of Jesus; Dorcas; N.B. Hardeman; David
                Lipscomb; Liff Sanders went to Nashville Bible School in
                1898, stayed one year, later began the church in Lubbock,
                Texas.

          7.   There are many such examples of salt:  John T. Lewis in
                Birmingham; Reece Boyd, Jasper, TN., etc.

V.   THE DANGER OF LOSING SAVOR:  CEASING TO BE PURE
      SALT.

     A.   The Lord teaches plainly that this can and does happen:  Loss
           of spirituality and/or power to salt (Mark 9:49,50).

     B.   Its doom:  To be rejected of God, trodden under foot by man, and
           become worthless.

          1.   "Salt without savor is fit only to be cast out and/or thrown
                away, according to Jesus.

          2.   It is not correct to say there is some good in every person, for
                the Lord says plainly that a professed Christian may lose his
                power for good so that he becomes "good for nothing, but to
                be cast out and trodden under foot of men."

     C.   A Christian who loses his influence for God is perverted from his
           divine purpose and is worthless  (Rev. 3:14-18; 2 Peter 2:20).

     D.   "The Valley of salt" near the Dead Sea with rock salt is a place of
           death (2 Sam. 8:13; 2 Kings 14:7; 1 Chron. 18:12; 2 Chron. 25:11;
           Psalm 60, title; etc.)

CONCLUSION -

I.   The power of godly influence is enormous.  When one is "dead to sin,
     alive unto God in Christ Jesus," he makes a great difference on
     earth (Romans 6:11).

II.   As Willard Collins said, "The influence of ten Abrahams could have
      saved Sodom.  A Christian must live in such a way that the ideals of
      Christ can be seen in his daily life.  This is the greatest contribution a
      child of God can make to his community in a time of crisis."--Collins,
      The Best of 20 Years, p.150.

III.  The Lord's words about his disciples being salt and light came after
      the beatitudes, not before.
                                                                      <I> --Charles E. Crouch</I>
