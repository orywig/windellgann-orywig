Charles E. Crouch was born in Wellington, Texas, and grew up near
Portland, Tennessee.  He received the B.A. Degree from David Lipscomb
College, and the M.A. Degree from George Peabody College for Teachers. 
He has preached regularly for churches of Christ in Baltimore, Maryland;
Nashville, Camden, Chattanooga, Oak Ridge and Greeneville, Tennessee;
Cleveland and Williamsburg Ohio; and Hayden, Ky.  His occasional
articles have appeared in the Gospel Advocate each year since 1958. 
Charles has held meeting in thirteen states and spoken on several
Christian college lectureships.  He has had several years experience in
radio work.  He is the author of<B><I> Principles of New Testament
Christianity,</B></I>  1984, Quality Publications, P.O. Box 1060, Abilene,
Texas, 79604.<P>


He is a diligent study of the Bible and has full content lessons such as
these on most of the books of the New Testament.  Perhaps in time some
of them will also be made available on the Internet.  <P>


Charles E. Crouch has this May, 1996, given permission for these lessons
to be posted and used by preachers and churches in their studies but
they are not to be printed commercially or sold.<P>


My appreciation to Charles Crouch and his fine wife Mildred for their
faithful work in the Lord's kingdom over the years.<P>
