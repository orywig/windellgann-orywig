____1. 	It seems that the Babylonian custom was to move captives to a foreign nation.
<pre>
</pre>

____2. 	Babylonia trained young men of captive nations for service to her.
<pre>
</pre>


____3. 	Daniel took credit himself for the interpretations of the dreams.
<pre>
</pre>


____4. 	Daniel was in Babylon the entire course of Judean captivity.
<pre>
</pre>


____5. 	Daniel ch. 4 appears as duplication of a document written by Neb. himself.
<pre>
</pre>


____6. 	There was to be 6 more world empires before God established his kingdom.
<pre>
</pre>


____7. 	Here in Daniel 2:44 is a hint that God's new kingdom would include more than just the Jewish people.
<pre>
</pre>

Note: 	Daniel was taken captive as a young boy at the beginning of the Babylonian captivity even before Jerusalem was destroyed.  He remained until Cyrus the Medo-Persian king came to the throne (he allowed the Israelites to return).  Daniel occupied positions of authority in both governments and probably never saw his home again.  He remained faithful to God.
