<p><font size="2">I. After completing his first tour
&quot;throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out
demons&quot; (Mark 1:39), Jesus returned to Capernaum to teach
(2:1).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">A. Capernaum was &quot;his own city&quot; </font><font
size="2" face="Times New Roman">(Matt . 9:1), &quot;the largest
city on the shore of the Sea of Galilee&quot; --Cox.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">B. This was evidently
his ordinary dwelling place after his rejection at Nazareth (Luke
4:30,31), where many of his mighty works were done (Matt .11:23;
Luke 10:15).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">C. He probably lived
with Peter (Mark 1:29).</font></p>

<p><br wp="BR1">
<br wp="BR2">
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">II. The primary purpose
of Jesus ministry was to heal sin--sick souls (Luke 19:10; 5:32),
but it is necessary to give proper attention to physical needs
(Acts 10:36--38; cf. Matt. 28:18--20; Gal. 6:10). </font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="3"><strong>I. JESUS TEACHES IN
CAPERNAUM</strong></font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">
(Mark 2:1 ,2).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">A. After some days:
&quot;And when he entered again into Capernaum after some days,
it was noised abroad that he was in the house&quot; (1).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">1. The excitement of the
lepers cure &quot;some days&quot; (perhaps weeks) earlier may not
have died down, and this may have helped gather the crowd.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">2. &quot;in the
house&quot; may refer to Peters house, or another. ASV footnote:
&quot;at home.&quot; Possibly he did live with Peter for a time.
See RSV &amp; NEB.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">B. He spake the word:
&quot;And many were gathered together, so that there was no
longer room for them, no, not even about the door: and he spake
the word unto them&quot; (2).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">1. Hearing of his
miracles, &quot;there were Pharisees and doctors of the law
sitting by, who were come out of every village of Galilee and
Judaea and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was with him to
heal&quot;(Luke 5:17).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">2. It is possible this
multitude, having &quot;scented heresy from afar,&quot; had not
gathered merely by chance or accident but by &quot;preconcerted
arrangement.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">3. &quot;And he spake
the word unto them,&quot; which was his primary mission,
regardless of the motives which gathered the hearers together.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">4. We should use every
possible opportunity to sow the seed and spread the kingdom even
in the presence of enemies of Christ.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4"><strong>II. THE HELPLESS
PARALYTIC</strong> </font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">(Mark
2:3).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">A. A sick man: &quot;And
they come, bringing unto him a man sick of the palsy, borne of
four&quot; (3).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">1. An illness or
infirmity affecting some part of the nervous system, either
feeling or power of riot ion.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">2. He was a pitiful
case, having lost the power to move himself.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">3. Dependent upon
others, he was brought upon a bed (Margin, &quot;pallet.&quot; v.
4).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">4. Paralysis is not such
a dreadful disease as leprosy, &quot;nor so painful as cancer,
nor so fatal&quot; as others. But no one likes to be such a
helpless burden upon family or friends.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">B. He was more than a
paralytic, however: He was a sinner (Mark 2:5; Luke 5:20), and,
as such, a representative man. (Cox). (See Conclusion I).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">1. Sin is mankinds worst
disease: It is a universal moral and spiritual ailment (Ran.
3:23; 1 John 1:8--10).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">2. All men greatly need
the Great Physician to be cured of this malady (Luke 5:30--32;
Matt. 13:15). </font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4"><strong>III. HELPING TO REACH
THE GREAT HEALER</strong> </font><font size="2"
face="Times New Roman">(Mark 2:4).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">A. Faith overcoming
obstacles: &quot;And when they could not come nigh unto him for
the crowd, they uncover ed the roof where he was; and when they
had broken it up, they let down the bed whereon the sick of the
palsy lay&quot;(4).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">1. Luke 5:19 says they
&quot;let him down through the tiles.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">2. The rafters were
covered with twigs, branches, then packed with soil, etc.; thus
were easily uncovered.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">B. His helpers were
faithful and persistent.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">1. He was &quot;borne of
four&quot; friends or relatives, who had enough faith in the Lord
to meet the demands of the occasion by overcoming difficulties.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">2. Faith will find a way
to remove or overcome its obstacles, when it works by love (Gal.
5:6). Those men evidently loved their lame friend.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">3. The determination of
those men to bring their helpless friend to Jesus is also
outstanding.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">4. They also demonstrate
an excellent example of the power of teamwork or cooperation: As
workers &quot;together with God&quot; (2 Car. 6:1; Phil. 1:27),
they accomplished what was too much for any one person alone.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">C. Sinners today must be brought to the feet of
Jesus to hear his word, the &quot;one thing needful&quot; (Lk.
10:42).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">1. Every sinner needs a friend who will do this
(Prov. </font><font size="1">11:30</font><font size="2">; Acts
26:16--18; James 5:19,20). Cf. Conclusion 2.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">2. Are you ready to be such a friend (Acts
21:13; Romans 1:14--17; Mark 16:15,16)?</font></p>

<p><font size="2">D. His hindrances (Some of these are always in
the Lords work). </font></p>

<p><font size="2">1. Hindrances without</font></p>

<p><font size="2">a. Crowds &amp; social pressure often stand
between sinners and Christ.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">b. The passive ones: Stood blocking the way
thru the door, not meaning any harm, yet they re present a
self--seeking, self--serving group, who, unmindful of the lost,
hindered a good work.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">c. The active hinderers: Cold carping critics,
ready with fiery darts, speakers from the seat of the scornful:
Malicious mean; party spirit; etc.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">2. Those hindrances within.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">a. We have always at hand difficulties which
would prevent all obedience to Christ, if we allow them to
overcome us with evil (Rom. 12:21).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">b. Wrong ideas, desires, passions, loyalty to
men, etc.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4"><strong>IV. THE GREAT PHYSICIAN
FORGIVES AND HEALS </strong></font><font size="2">(2:5--7).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">A. &quot;And Jesus seeing their faith saith
unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins are forgiven&quot; (5).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">1. When faith is visible, it is living,
effectual and rewarding (James 2:14--26).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">2. Jesus must have surprised them with his
first words.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">B. The Great Physician has authority to forgive
sins.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">1. The words, &quot;Son, thy sins are forgiven,
affirm his divine authority, for only deity could claim to
forgive without blasphemy.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">2. His words also reveal his sympathetic heart.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">3. His words set the stage for a demonstration
of his divine authority.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">4. The Great Physician has and gives what we
need most: Forgiving mercy, through his gospel, which is Gods
power to save (Romans 1:16).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">C. Jesus censured: &quot;But there were certain
of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, Why
doth this man thus speak? he blasphemeth: for who can forgive
sins but one, even God&quot; (6,7)?</font></p>

<p><font size="2">1. Knowing &quot;the hearts of all men&quot;
(Acts 1:24; Heb. 4:13; Rev. 2:23), Jesus perceived their
reasoning.</font></p>

<p>2. Based upon false premises concerning Jesus, their reasoning
led them to false conclusions about the Lords actions.</p>

<p><br wp="BR1">
<br wp="BR2">
</p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4"><strong>V. JESUS QUESTIONS
THEIR REASONING</strong></font> (2:8,9).</p>

<p><font size="2">A. which is easier to say? &quot;And
straigbtwav Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned
within themselves, saith unto them, Why reason ye these things in
your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy,
Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and
walk&quot; (8,9)?</font></p>

<p><font size="2">B. According to Matthew 9:4, he asked,
&quot;Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts&quot;?</font></p>

<p><font size="2">C. The &quot;heart&quot; reasons, thinks,
purposes, ponders, understands, desires, believes and obeys (9:4;
2:8; Acts 11:23; Luke 2:19; Matt </font><font size="2"
face="Arial">. </font><font size="2">13:15; Rom. 10:1,10; 6:17).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">D. The Lords question presented his critics
with a dilemma, as he often did, from which they could not
extricate themselves.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4"><strong>VI. JESUS PROVES HIS
AUTHORITY TO FORGIVE SIN </strong></font><font size="2">(2:10--12).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">A. Purpose of the miracle: &quot;But that ye
may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive
sins (he saith to the sick of the palsy). </font><font size="2"
face="Arial">.&quot; </font><font size="2">(10).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">B. Three commands a paralytic could not obey:
&quot;I say unto thee, Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thy
house&quot; (11).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">C. Try to visualize the scene: Tense, dramatic
moment---- the man &quot;arose, and straightway took up the bed,
and went forth before them all. </font><font size="2"
face="Arial">. . &quot; </font><font size="2">(1 2a)</font></p>

<p><font size="2">D. Effect of the miracle: </font><font size="1"
face="Arial">&quot;. . </font><font size="2">.they were all
amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this
fashion.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">1. &quot;They wore afraid, and glorified God,
who had given such authority unto men&quot; (Matt. 9:8).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">2. &quot;And amazement took hold on all, and
they glorified God; and they wore filled with fear, saying, We
have seen strange things today&quot; (Luke 5:26).</font></p>

</p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>CONCLUSION </strong></font><font
size="2" face="Arial"><strong>--</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">1. &quot;Palsy is a fit emblem of sins
paralyzing power and of the utter helplessness of the sinner to
do anything for his own relief. Yet the cross made possible a
merciful provision for a palsied race&quot; (Rom.
5:6)----Lockyer.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">II. &quot;While no moral paralytic can be saved
by anothers faith, yet that one can be brought to another by
him&quot; -- Lockyer.</font></p>
