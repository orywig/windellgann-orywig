<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	A Persian legend tells us that a certain king needed a faithful servant and had to choose between
two candidates for the office.  He took both at fixed wages and told them to fill a basket with water
from a nearby well, saying that he would come in the evening to inspect their work.  After dumping
one or two buckets of water into the basket, one of the men said, "What is the good of doing this
useless work?  As soon as we pour the water in, it runs out the sides."</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	The other answered, "But we have our wages, haven't we?  The purpose is the master's
business, not ours."</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	"I'm not going to do such a fool's work," replied the complainer.  Throwing down his bucket, he
went away.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	The other man continued until he had drained the well.  Looking down into it, he saw something
shining at the bottom that proved to be a diamond ring.  "How I see the use of pouring water into the
basket!" he exclaimed.  "If the bucket had brought up the ring before the well was dry, it would have
been found in the basket.  Out work was not useless."</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	When God's blessings does not fully coincide with your expectations, remember to wait until
the well is dry.  There may be something precious at the bottom.  There may be a very good reason
why God has placed you where you are, doing what you are doing.</SPAN></P>

same from us?  The problem is that in our religious activities we see ourselves as volunteers rather

city gate where he had been placed by the captain, with his hands still grasping his weapon.  There,
while the earth shook beneath him- there, while the floods of ashes and cinders covered him- he had
