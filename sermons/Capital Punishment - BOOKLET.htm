arrest.  In Luke 22, Jesus reminds the apostles how he had sent them out with
the seventy on the limited commission to go preaching to Israel only.  But
shortly they are to be sent out again with another commission.  In verse 35:</font></span></p>

Nothing.  Then said he unto them,  But now, he that hath

that hath no sword let him sell his garment, and buy one.
... And they said, Lord, behold here are two swords.  And

ask, what purpose would they have for two swords?  Let us remember that they
were traveling from place to place;  and Jesus told a true-to-life story in Luke
10 when he told of a man traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho who fell among
thieves and was beaten, robbed and left for dead.  The only purpose that we
can think of for such a sword as this was for protection when there should be
a threat to their live.</font></span></p>

two swords they had.  In Matthew 26, Jesus is in the Garden of Gethsemane
and sees the mob sent to arrest him approaching.  Jesus wakes the sleeping
apostles, and Peter seeing the mob armed with swords and staves hastily says
to Jesus, "Shall we use the sword?"  And before the Lord responds to Peter,
Peter begins hacking away and cuts off one of the men's ear before Jesus can
tell him to put his sword up.  Jesus restored the man's ear then said to Peter,
"Put up again thy sword into his place;  for all they that take the sword shall
perish with the sword."  (Matthew 26:52;  Mark 14:47; Luke 22:49).  Jesus is
probably alluding to Genesis 9:6 and the principle of capital punishment for
murderer.</font></span></p>

before Festus the governor.  Paul says,  "For if I be an offender, or have

of these things whereof these accuse me, no many may deliver me unto them. 
I appeal unto Caesar."</font></span></p>

punishment.  He found no fault with the law which prescribed that a man who
committed certain terrible crimes was worthy of death.  Paul said, "If I have
done that, I refuse not to die."  That is, Let the law be carried out and let me
be put to death.  Paul's argument in defense was that he had not committed the
crimes of which he was accused.  He does not argue with the law of capital
punishment but upholds the right of civil authority to execute wicked
criminals.</font></span></p>

that those who are law-abiding need have no fear of punishment, but that the
government exists for the purpose of restraining criminal activity;  it exists for
the purpose of giving protection and safety to those that are law-abiding.  
When the government becomes soft and permissive toward the criminal
element, the civil government is not performing its function that God has given
it to do.  As Christians, we ought to encourage our government to perform its
God-given task and duty.  (Hab. 1:4) </font> </span></p>

punishment.  A statement made by John Lewis Evans a convicted murdered
sentenced to death in Alabama appeared in a Birmingham newspaper
sometime back as he was fighting to stay alive. (<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Birmingham News,
</span>Thursday, April 5, 1979, p. 63.)  With reference to the death penalty, he says:</font></span></p>

<span style="font-family:Times New Roman, serif"><font size="4">Society says that I have a debt to pay.  We are paying and
have paid the debt.  Will our death bring back a life-- will
it stop crime-- will it 'rehabilitate'-- NO WAY.  Stripped
of all legal jargon, it boils down to the fact that there
remains one motive only 'Revenge'--.  You say you are a
Christian Society.  Strange, you do not follow the principle
of your founder who spoke of love, understanding, mercy,
forgiveness.  (<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Birmingham News,</span>  4/5/1979, p.63.)</font></span></p>

who argue against the death penalty.  In the first place he thinks of execution
as simply having <span style="font-weight: bold"><i>one</i></span> motive, <span style="font-weight: bold"><i>revenge.</i></span>  Revenge may be a proper motive,  we
read in verse 4 "...for he is a minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon
him that doeth evil."  In one sense we might look upon capital punishment as
a revenge of society upon a murderer.  In the previous chapter of Romans, Paul
said, "Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: 
for it is written, Vengeance is min; I will repay, saith the Lord."  (Romans
12:19).</font></span></p>

"Vengeance is mine."  Now, what is the arm of the Lord to execute vengeance
upon the criminal?  It is the civil authority (Rom. 13:4)  "For he is the minister
of God to thee for good.  But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he
beareth not the sword in vain:  for he is the minister of God, a revenger to
execute wrath upon him that doeth evil."</font></span></p>

in fact, it is not the paramount reason.  Yes, it is <span style="font-weight: bold">discipline.</span>  It is the ultimate
discipline for the ultimate crime.  When we discipline our children do we think
of it as <span style="font-weight: bold"><i>revenge?</i></span>  No, it is <span style="font-weight: bold">discipline</span>, for the purpose of teaching, or

call yourself a Christian Society."  He could not see how Christians, who are
suppose to be loving, forgiving, and merciful, could favor capital punishment
and be consistent with their profession.  Yet, absolutely it is consistent.  We
are not being "Christian" and are <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> following Christ and following God
<span style="font-weight: bold">unless</span> we call for God's will on this issue to be practiced.</font></span></p>

They think God is "all loving" and God is "all forgiving."  They overlook
another aspect of God's character-- God is Holy, God is Just; and He demands
justice and fairness.  God demands the civil authorities to give protection to
the law abiding.  This is what Paul says in Romans 13:2-4.</font></span></p>

be afraid"  (Rom. 13:4).  Fear of punishment is a deterrent to doing evil.  The
second reason is given in verse 5.  "Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not
only for wrath, but also for conscience sake."  The second reason why we need
to obey the law is for conscience sake.  If we train our conscience to abide by
the laws of the land and to be fair, just and honest with every man, everything
will work all right!  But what about those who have not trained their
conscience-- whose conscience is not pricked  when breaking the law?  What
is left to keep them law-aiding? Fear of punishment!  What will then happen
to society if fear of punishment is removed?  There will be no restraints
remaining upon a society to have order, or any justice to it.</font></span></p>
