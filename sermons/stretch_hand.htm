<p>Introduction:</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>1. We are going to be looking at Mark 3:1-7. But I want you to imagine in
    Jesus’ day the editor of the <b>Galilee Gazette</b> running excitedly into
    the press room shouting, &quot;Stop the Press! Stop the Press!&quot; We have
    a new headline – it reads:</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b>Jesus Attends Worship Service</p>
      <p>Local Man Receives Great Blessing</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</b>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>In Mark 3 we’ll look at what should have made the headlines, had there
    actually been a Galilee Gazette.</p>
    <p>2. Perhaps its not as sensational, and doesn’t make head-lines today
    either, but Jesus was here at our worship service this morning, and he’s
    here again tonight. How many today have received great blessings from Him?</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>a. I want to ask, HOW can you and I get a great blessing?</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>3. In the pass I have heard some lament, &quot;Well, I didn’t get
    anything out of the worship.&quot;</p>
    <p>Question: Did you bring anything to put it in?</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>a. Old time preachers use to say, &quot;When you go to the spring for
        water, you’ve got to take a bucket.&quot;</p>
        <p>b. Did we bring our bucket today?</p>
        <p>c. Some come with a sieve – and <b>everything</b> pours right
        through!</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Some come with a bucket with holes – and much leaks out</p>

    <p>4. Open your Bibles to Mark 3:1-7. This will be our procedure:</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>1) We will look at the background to this section of scripture.</p>
        <p>2) We will look at the passage verse by verse –</p>
        <p>3) We will look at some lessons to remember from this passage.</p>
      </dir>

    <p>5. Background – Jesus’ return from Judean ministry. Religious leaders
    becoming hostile.</p>

  <dir>
    <p>1. &quot;They&quot; = Pharisees &amp; scribes (Lk.6:7)</p>
    <p>2. &quot;They&quot; were at worship but were &quot;spectators&quot;
    (watching)</p>
    <p>3. &quot;Cure on Sabbath&quot; The Pharisees themselves were divided into
    two schools of though over how much health care a physician could give on
    the Sabbath. Many believed that he could give &quot;life-threatening&quot;
    help to the sick, but no more. He couldn’t treat routine sickness.</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>a. But the Pharisees were more interested in keeping their traditions
        than in showing mercy or compassion for the man.</p>
        <p>b. Lost their sense of values – if a man has one sheep to fall into
        pit, would rescue it!</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>4. &quot;Accuse him&quot; = The Pharisees were hoping to be able to
    accuse Jesus of being a Sabbath breaker, and worthy of death.</p>
    <p>5. Some think man was planted. But probably just here to worship. But
    they were aware of him.</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>a. Seems he had no part in their plot. I’m sure he was most
        grateful for the blessing he received from the Lord.</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>7. They knew the Lord was compassionate -- use it to entrap him!?</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>a. Some had come to the synagogue that day to worship God –</p>
        <p>b. Apparently some were there as spectators –</p>
        <p>c. Some were there, self-righteous, and looking for faults in others,
        and critical --</p>
        <p>d. Some there with injured lives and needing God’s help to make
        them whole again.</p>

<p>1. &quot;Rise and come forward&quot; &quot;Stand forward&quot; KJV, before
them. As if the man himself were on trial whether he had right to be healed or
not, whether he is more valuable than a sheep.</p>
<p>2. So the whole congregation could now see him.</p>
<p>3. Seeing the man should have caused them to have compassion on him -- not
harden their hearts against him being healed.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>a. We need to look with compassion on those needing God’s help.</p>

    <p>1. Jesus deals first with the spectators so if possible to prevent them
    from being offended.</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>a. Jesus shows us a good rule to follow here when dealing with
        people, Prevent offence if possible.</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>2. Jesus asks a rhetorical question (vs. 4) -- not sure if he even
    expected an answer.</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>a. They couldn’t answer. Put them into a dilemma.</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>3. Jesus considered if one had the power to do good and didn’t, it was
    evil.</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>a. The wording here is &quot;good&quot; vs &quot;evil&quot; – we’d
        say &quot;right&quot; vs. &quot;wrong&quot;</p>
        <p>b. On the Lord’s day which is best – to save a life or to kill?</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>4. &quot;Silent&quot; -- they were learning his power of logic and truth
    and didn’t want to publicly appear un-compassionate.</p>

    <p>5. Mark 3.5</p>
  </font></b>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>1. Jesus looked around &quot;<i>peri-blepomai&quot; </i>and all-inclusive
    penetrating look. Eye-to-eye with everyone in the room.</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>a. This wording is characteristic of Mark. v.34; 5:32; 10:23; 11:11)</p>
        <p>b. It seems to be the wording of an eye-witnesses. This an
        eye-witness account.</p>
        <p>c. Possibly Mark himself, probably just a teenager at the time–
        seems to have witnessed many of these events in the life of our Lord.</p>
        <dir>
          <dir>
            <p>1) Many believe the young disciple who followed Jesus and the
            apostles out in the night to the Mount of Olives was Mark himself
            – Mark 14:51-52.</p>
          </dir>
        </dir>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>2. Luke (6:8) adds that Jesus knew what they were thinking.</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>a. cf. John 2:25. Jesus knew the hearts of all those who had come to
        the worship service.</p>
        <p>b. Don’t you know he still does today!</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>3. Jesus’ <b><i>anger</b></i>.</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>a. Aorist tense - carries the sense of momentary anger.</p>
        <p>b. <b><i>Grieve</b></i> is present tense, sense of continuing grief.</p>
        <p>c. As he saw what they were thinking in their hearts as they
        pretended to be worshiping God – and shortly we will see what was in
        their thoughts and <b>why</b> he was angry.</p>
        <p>d. His anger was accompanied with grief, for he knew their sin, and
        the awfrul consequences which it would bring upon them.</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>4. He was angry because they were not compassionate over the man’s
    condition.</p>
    <p>5. Angry at their malice and wicked hearts.</p>
    <p>6. His anger was controlled, and didn’t lead him to sin.</p>
    <p>7. Jesus commanded the man to &quot;stretch forth his hand.&quot; The man
    promptly obeyed. He had come to center state and now stretches out his hand.</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>a. Jesus only asked man to &quot;stretch out his hand&quot; and didn’t
        appear to &quot;do&quot; anything. The man &quot;did&quot; the action.
        Jesus didn’t apply medicine, or even wave his hand, etc. so they
        couldn’t accuse his of &quot;working&quot; after all! They were
        caught!</p>
        <p>b. His hand &quot;restored&quot; (NIV adds &quot;completely
        restored&quot;) As whole as the other.</p>
        <p>c. Their attempt to catch Jesus &quot;working&quot; on the Sabbath
        was frustrated.</p>
        <p>The man himself had done all the action. Jesus only spoke. What could
        they accuse him of <i>doing</i>.</p>

  <dir>
    <p>1. The Pharisees then Went out from the service.</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>a. Can’t you imagine their &quot;huff.&quot;</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>2. They Counseled with the Herodians -- a political party they usually
    despised and wouldn’t associate with.</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>a. NOW we are going to see their heart – as Jesus had already seen
        it in the synagogue.</p>
        <p>b. So they are hypocritical, now associating with those they usually
        condemned as evil and wicked, for the purpose of destroying a righteous
        man!</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>3. Plotting to put Jesus to death. &quot;To kill&quot; cf. verse 4.
    Remember Jesus’ works!</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>a. Plotting on the Sabbath to do &quot;evil&quot;, to
        &quot;kill.&quot; Jesus knew their hearts (Luke 6:8 )</p>
        <p>b. This laid bare the hypocrisy of the Pharisees who objected to
        Jesus’ healing the crippled man on the Sabbath, but they were
        themselves spending the day in plots to kill Jesus.</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>4. Must choose to do good and be helpful to others, or to do evil and
    plot murder.</p>
    <p>5. &quot;<b><i>Plotting</b></i>&quot; -- the first of four such
    references in Mark 11:18; Mark 12:12; Mark 14:1.</p>
    <p>6. Pharisees were influential. They thought of themselves as being so
    righteous and holy. But when it suited their purpose counseled with others
    for evil purposes (cf. 15:1)</p>

    <p>7. Mark 3.7</p>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>1. It is interesting to note in verse 7 that while his enemies plotted <b><i>Jesus
    withdrew</b></i>. He wasn’t ready to cause a confrontation.</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>a. Sometimes it is better to wait and not cause a disturbance.</p>
        <p>b. Jesus withdrew rather than create a confrontation. His hour was
        not yet come.</p>
        <p>Many were following him. If he was a <b>rebel</b> he could have
        turned the country-side upside down. But that was not his purpose at
        all.</p>

  <dir>
    <p>1. Remember there are definite advantages of going to worship where Jesus
    is.</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>a. Jesus is present (he attended regularly) and his presence brings a
        blessings.</p>
        <p>b. His presence was a blessing to every devout worshiper in the
        assembly.</p>
        <p>c. Just as he healed this obedience man, when we come humbly in
        &quot;obedience&quot; we can be healed of our spiritual ills.</p>
        <p>d. When we miss a service with Jesus, we miss an blessing to our
        soul. What a loss it would have been to this poor man if he had not been
        in the synagogue that day!</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>2. &quot;Doing good&quot; is a characteristic of a Christian.</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>a. Acts 10:34 describes Jesus as &quot;going about and doing
        good.&quot;</p>
        <p>b. Doing &quot;good and not evil&quot; – doing right and not wrong.
        Many today accuse doing good as being evil. We definitely need to get
        our &quot;goods&quot; and &quot;evils&quot; lined up right.</p>
        <p>c. We see it every where today – there is a bitter antagonism to
        holiness in unholy hearts!</p>

        <p>Acts 16:14 - the Lord opened the heart of Lydia when she went out to
        worship one day.</p>
