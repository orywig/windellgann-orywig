angels are primarily the ministers of God's providence.
The scriptures have much to say about angels. Yet,
today there is a very general disregard for the subject.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">2. <span>&#160;</span>Actually, members of the church of the Lord, generally
speaking, give little or no thought for the subject. Many
brethren have never heard a sermon, or studied a lesson
regarding the subject of "angels."</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>1. <span>&#160;</span>Relative to the origin of angels, God asked Job:
"Where was thou when I laid the foundations of the
earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath
determined the measures thereof, if thou knowest?
Or who stretched the line upon it? Where upon were
the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the
corner-stone thereof, When the morning stars sang
together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy"
(Job 38:4-7).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">The "sons of God" shouted for joy when God laid the
founations of the earth, but Adam was not created
until the sixth day of creation. Who, then, were those
sons of God? Without doubt, they were angels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2. <span>&#160;</span>Angels, however, were not in the beginning and thus
from eternity. For instance, Nehemiah 9:6 reads
"Thou art Jehovah, even thou alone; thou hast made
heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host,
the earth and all things thereon..." (Neh. 9:6).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">In short, Jehovah made or created the "host" of
angels. Psalms 148 indicates that God created all--
that is, the host-- and then called upon the whole
creation to praise him. The reading is as follows:
"Praise ye Jehovah.  Praise ye  Jehovah from the
heavens: Praise him in the heights. Praise ye him all
his angels: Praise ye him, all his host. Praise ye him,
sun and moon: Praise him, all ye stars of light. Praise
him, ye heavens of heavens, And ye waters that are
above the heavens. Let them praise the name of
Jehovah; For he commanded, and they were created"
(Psalm 148:1-5).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">Emphasis should be placed on the fact that there
were no angels until Jehovah commanded, and then
they were created.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>3.<span>&#160;&#160;</span>The apostle Paul wrote:  "For this cause I bow my
knees unto the Father, from whom every family in
heaven and on earth is named,..." (Eph. 3:14,15).
This scripture affirms that God has a family. It also
affirms that part of the family is in heaven, and part
is on earth. The family in heaven also consist of
angels-- of created beings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>4. <span>&#160;</span>Further, the author of Hebrews wrote: "...but ye are
come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the
living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to
innumerable hosts of angels, to the general assembly
and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in
heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits
of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator
of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling
that speaketh better than that of Abel" (Heb.
12:22-24).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">Thus heaven is composed of innumerable hosts of
angels. The very thought of this reading from
Hebrews staggers one's imagination.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>5.<span>&#160;&#160;</span>Paul wrote the Colossians of thrones, dominions,
principalities, and powers, and by these he must have
spoken of the organizations among the good angels.
He said, "...who is the image of the invisible God,
the firstborn of all creation; for in him were all
things created, in the heavens and upon the earth,
things visible and things invisible, whether thrones
or dominions or principalities, or powers; all things
have been created through him, and unto him; and he
is before all things, and in him all things consist"
(Col. 1:15-17).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">In this quote, Paul adds that the invisible things of
heaven-- which certainly includes angels-- were
created through him and unto him. That angels are
created beings is an inescapable conclusion. Angels
were not-- are not- therefore, glorified human beings.
Jesus said that glorified human beings would be <i><span style="font-weight: bold">as
</span></i>angels, but he did not say they would be angels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">Angels were created as a company, as individuals,
and not as a race. Angels had no sex distinctions.
Jesus said, "...Ye do err, not knowning the scriptures,
nor power of God. For in the resurrection they never
marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in
heaven." (Matt. 22:29-30).</span></p>

and were therefore, free moral agents. The will of an
angel was, and is autonomous. Had angels been
created otherwise, they would have been mere robots
and thus unable to serve as the ministers of God's
providence. Angels were placed under law;
otherwise they would not have had the freedom of
will.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">To illustrate how that angels were under law, David
wrote: "Bless Jehovah, ye his angels. That are
mighty in strength, that fulfill his word, Hearkening
unto the voice of his word. Bless Jehovah, all ye his
hosts, Ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure"
(Psalms 103:20-21).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">Jude wrote: "And angels that kept not their own
principality, but left their proper habitation, he hath
kept in everlasting bonds under darkness unto the
judgment of the great day" (Jude 6).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">Peter wrote: "...God sparednot angels when they
sinned, but cast them down to hell, and committed
them to pits of darkness, to be reserved unto
judgment" (2 Pet. 2:4).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">There can be no question--angels were under law,
and disobedient angels were cast out of heaven and
down to the abyss.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2. <span>&#160;</span>Angels are of a higher order than man, but they are
of a lower order than that of God, Christ, and the
Holy Spirit. When Jesus came in the flesh, he was
thereby made, "a little lower than the angels," and
this fact indicates that man was of a lower order than
that of angels (Heb. 2:7). Angels are "... ministering
spirits, sent forth to do service for the sake of them
that shall inherit salvation" (Heb. 1:14).</span></p>

angels are invisible to the unaided human vision.
They are incorporeal, that is they are not made of
material substance. Balaam's ass was permitted to
see the angel of Jehovah that stood in the way, and
she lay down under Balaam. "Then Jehovah opened
the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Jehovah
standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his
hand" (Num. 22:23).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">In the days of Elisha, the king of Syria sent a host
with horses and chariots to take him.  Elisha's
servant said: "Alas, my master! How shall we do?"
Elisha said, "Fear not; for they that are with us are
more than they that are with them" (2 Kings
6:15-16).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">"And Elisha prayed, and said, Jehovah, I pray thee,
open his eyes, that he may see.  And Jehovah opened
the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold,
the mountain was full of horses and chariots round
about Elisha.&#8221; (2 Kings 6:17).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">There can be no doubt; those horses and chariots
were angelic beings. Neither the angel that stopped
Balaam&#8217;s ass, nor the horses and chariots were seen
by the unaided human eye.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2. <span>&#160;</span>For another thing, angels were and are capable of
assuming any form in which God is pleased to
employ them. As has been observed, angels appears
as horses and chariots. An angel appeared to Moses
as a flame of fire in the midst of a bush which burned
and was not consumed. This angels was probably
none other then the second person of the Godhead.
The passage of scripture reads: "And the angel of
Jehovah appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of
the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold, the
bush burned with fire, and the bush was not
consumed" (Ex. 3:2).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">The Hebrew writer wrote: "And of the angels he
saith, Who maketh his angels winds, And his
ministers a flame of fire:" (Heb. 1:7). The point is
that just as one cannot see the wind he cannot see an
angel; but an angel once appeared as a flame of fire
and in other forms as well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>3. <span>&#160;</span>Angels very frequently appear as men. Angels
appeared as men to Abraham, and Jehovah was one
of them (Gen. 18:1,2). Angels appeared as men to
Lot (Gen. 19:1,2). At that time "Jehovah [the word
or second person of the Godhead] rained upon
Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and from
from Jehovah [the first person of the Godhead] out
of heaven" (Gen. 19:24).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">An angel appeared as a man to Manoah (Judges
13:9). Jacob wrestled until the breaking of the day
with an angel who appeared in the form of a man
(Gen. 32:22-28). The angel that made known to the
women at the sepulchre the resurrection of Jesus was
a young man (Mark 16:5). The two angels who
proclaimed the return of Jesus as the ascension from
the summit of Mount Olivet, appeared as men
clothed in white apparel (Acts 1:10,11). [A question
might be raised as to the "tongues parting asunder
like as of fire" which came upon the apostles on
Pentecost. Might those "tongues like as of fire" have
been angels?  cf. 1Cor. 13:1.]</span></p>

are superhuman in knowledge, but they are not
omniscient, as all knowning, as God is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">To illustrate how that angels are superhuman in
knowledge, let's consider the following in order:
Three angels, in the form of men, announced to
Abraham that his wife Sarah-- then ninety years of
age-- would have a son when the season cometh
round (Gen. 18:10). One of the three was none other
than Jehovah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">The Angel, Gabriel, who stands in the presence of
God, announced to Zacharias that his wife Elizabeth,
then advanced in years, would bear a son, that his
name should be called John (Luke 1:11-19).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">An angel announced to the virgin, Mary, that she
would bear a son begotten of God by the Holy Spirit
(Luke 1:26-37). The first announcement of a Savior
born was made by an angel to the shepherds who
watched their flocks in the plain of Bethlehem by
night (Luke 2:13,14). An angel warned Joseph to
flee to Egypt lest Herod slay the Christ child (Matt.
2:13-15). Two angels in the form of men in white
apparel announced that this Jesus who was received
up from you into heaven shall so come in like
manner as ye beheld him going into heaven (Acts
1:10,11).</span></p>

not omniscient is illustrated by the following: Peter
declared-- regarding the preaching of the prophets
beforehand of the sufferings of Christ, and the
glories that should be revealed-- declared "which
things angels desire to look into" (I Pet.1:10-12). In
short, the angels did not know the meaning of all that
was taking place with respect to the plan of
redemption for man.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">Angels did not know when the judgment would
come upon Jerusalem. Jesus said, "But of the day
and hour knoweth no one, not even the angels of
heaven, neither the son, but the Father only" (Matt.
24:36). Angels are not, therefore, omniscient, or all
knowing though they are superhuman in knowledge.</span></p>

pestilence from Dan to Beersheba, seventy thousand
men (2 Sam. 14:15-17). An angel of the Lord smote
in the camp of the Assyrians 185,000 of the mighty
men of valor, leaders, and captians (2 Kings

angel shut the mouths of the lions so that they did
not hurt Daniel (Dan. 6:22). An angel of the Lord
descended from heaven and came and rolled away
the great stone-- which weighted about 4,000
pounds-- from the door of the sepulchre (Matt.
28:2-4). An angel of the Lord by night opened the
prison doors and brought the apostles out, and said,
"Go ye, and stand and speak in the temple to the
people all the words of this life" (Acts 5:19).</span></p>

allowed the people to honor him as a god, and Herod
was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost (Acts
12:23). When Peter was bound with two chains and
made to sleep between two soldiers, and watchmen
were placed before the doors of Herod's prison,
which doors were secured by iron gates, bolts, bars,
and locks; an angel entered the prison and led Peter
out as though nothing had been in the way. The iron
gate opened to them of its own accord, and they went
out (Acts 12:10). Peter, when writing of the spirit of
ungodly men and how they were self-willed and
ready to rail at dignities, said: "Whereas angels,
though greater in might and power bring not a railing
judgment against them before the Lord" (2 Pet.
2:11). Thus Peter, incidental to his main theme,
stated that angels are "greater in might and power,"
than is man.</span></p>

omnipotent is illustrated by the fact that when, in the
days of David, the angel that had just destroyed
70,000 stretched out his had upon Jerusalem to
destroy it, the Lord repented him of the evil and said
to the angel that destroyed the people: "It is enough;
stay now thine hand" (2 Sam.24:15,16). The angel
had no power except as the Lord exerted his power
though him. Angels are not, therefore, omnipotent,
or all powerful, though they are superhuman in
power.</span></p>

Bible of good angels and bad angels, their number,
and something of their work. Sometimes people
speak of "guardian angels" who supposedly are
assigned to accompany and help individuals. Is this
a Biblical doctrine? </span></p>

do? What kind of protection, as the name implies,
does he give? Does he, as one religious group claims
"assist them in their attainment of salvation"? Does
he suggest thoughts, or act as an intermediary?</span></p>

standard English Bible, but one of the basic texts
upon which such a belief rests is Psalms 91:11 "he
will give his angels charge of you to guard you in all
your ways."</span></p>

Testaments which suggest that persons have what we
might prefer to call "attendant or ministering angels"
(Matthew 18:10; Heb. 1:14; Psalms 34:7; Acts
12:15; Acts 27:23).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">We find in the book of Daniel the inference that
nations too have "guardian angels". Michael seems
to have been the patron angel of the Jewish people
(Daniel 10:13,20; 12:1). It seems that other nations
also enjoyed such angelic guardianship (Daniel 10).</span></p>

Old Testament as messengers, but there were those
that provided Elijah with food, directed the nation of
Israel in the wilderness, appeared with the Hebrew
children in the fiery furnace, and protected Daniel in
the lion's den by shutting the lion's mouth.</span></p>

guardian angels emerges clearly. In the Book of
Tobias, the father asks God to bless his son's journey
and send his angel as a companion for the trip. He
then comforts his weeping wife with the words "a
good angels shall accompany him." In this period of
literature the guardian angel is also viewed as an
intermediary in prayers.</span></p>

played up as anything important in either of
Testaments. The daily presence and work of angels
is not clearly defined in the Bible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt">One scholar on angels suggests the reason angels had
little significance in the Israelite life of faith was
because their consciousness was of God and His
place with them. Perhaps little is told us of angels so
we will not fall into worshipping them (Rev. 2:8,9)
and giving them more recognition than God (Col.
2:18).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.104167in"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Conclusion</span>. While accepting the idea of "ministering
angels" (Heb. 1:14, at least for the saints), we reject the
idea that they suggest thought to us or act independently
of the gospel of Christ to accomplish salvation. Most of
the information about angels and just how they are
helping us remain a mystery. Perhaps it is better to be
careful and ascribe them neither more nor less work and
glory than the Bible tells of them.</span></p>
