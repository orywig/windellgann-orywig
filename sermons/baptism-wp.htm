<p>In our sermon series, we studied Faith, Repentance, and the Good Confession.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>

<p>It logically follows that our next sermon in the series should be on Baptism.  It is very probably
that in the minds of some is the question, </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Why? ]</span></p>
<p>Why another sermon on Baptism?   Some think that this subject has been discussed and debated
for hundreds of years, and in the minds of many religious minded people, it has never been settled. 
Why then continue to disturb the minds of people with it?  This objection involves a serious
mistake.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Man and woman thinking ]</span></p>
<p>It may be true, that in the mind of many the issue is not settled; that is, everyone has not come to
the same agreement in regard to baptism.   But in another, and a very important sense, it has been
settled thousands and thousands of times.  It has been settled in the minds of men and women
who realize they have to give an account to God in the great day of judgment.  And let me say to
those of you who are here today, there is a necessity laid upon you, and you cannot avoid it, that
you must also settle the question in your own mind and for the sake of your own soul.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Baptism required for membership ]</span></p>
<p>Up until less than 50 to 75 years ago, when a number of religious bodies in the U.S. swept from
256 to today of over 3,000 different splintered religious groups, you could not become a member
of any of those early 256 groups, with the exception of the Quakers, without submitting to an
ordinance which that church called <span style="text-decoration: underline">baptism</span>.   If you were ever to become a member of any church
you were compelled to settle the issue of &#8220;baptism&#8221; as far as you were concerned.</p>
<br>
<p>Some may answer, &#8220;No, Brother Gann,&#8221; the question was settled for me by my parents when I
was an infant, and they baptized me.&#8221;  Even this does not enable you to escape the necessity for
you to decide for yourself before God whether you will be satisfied with that as <i>your</i> obedience to
this divine command from God.   It is imperative that you consider it, because we will all give an
account to God in the day of judgment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Baptism ]</span></p>
<p>So, don&#8217;t be impatient with me when I propose we look at this subject afresh.  But be willing to
open your mind, and just hear what is presented today.   Whatever position a man may take,
whichever side of this controversial question he stands on, everyone of us should be willing to
listen candidly, to weight the issue fairly, and to decide the question intelligently.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>

<p>But one man may say, &#8220;According to my understanding of this controversy, it requires some
knowledge of a dead language called Greek, in order to render an intelligent decision as to what
baptism is; and as I am no scholar, I think God will not hold me to an account if I should happen
to decide in incorrectly.&#8221;   Well, my friend, it is a mistake to suppose that it requires scholarship in
any dead language to determine what baptism is.   </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>

<p>And, friend, it is possible that every man who has ordinary common sense can take his own
English New Testament, and learn from a careful study of it, what God requires of him in order
that he may live a life well pleasing in the sight of our Maker.</p>
<br>
<p>What course then is a man to take, who knows only his English, to learn this subject and settle in
his mind the issue of &#8220;baptism&#8221;?  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Picture of an older man ( J.W. McGarvey) ]</span></p>
<p>&#160;A good many, many years ago, I read of man who made this remark: &#8220;If my mind were unsettled
in regard to baptism, I would take this course: </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Read All the New Testament ]</span></p>
<p>&#8211;I would take my own New Testament, and beginning at the first chapter of Matthew, I would
read it all the way through, </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Watch for the subject ]</span></p>
<p>watching for that word &#8220;baptism&#8221;; and everywhere I found it, </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Examine the context ]</span></p>
<p>I would examine carefully the passage in which I found it, </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Put it all together ]</span></p>
<br>
<p>and learn all I could about it; and when I got through I would put all of this together, and I would
make up my mind on the whole subject of baptism that way.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>This is the Lord teaching me ]</span></p>
<p>Then I would feel sure that it was God teaching me, and that he would approve my decision.&#8221;</p>
<br>
<p>That remark has had a great impact on me through the years.  I think it is a great way to study any
subject, and the proper way.  It does not involve arguments on the subject by other men.  It
involves nothing but listening to the utterances of God&#8217;s word, forming our own conclusions, and
then following the course taken from the scriptures themselves. </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>

<p>Now if that is not a safe procedure, I don&#8217;t know what is.  You may imagine it a very big task to
read the book through and through, and noticing the passages we&#8217;re concerned with, but it&#8217;s not
nearly a big a task as one may imagine.   I propose that we study our subject today just this way,
but you may think well the preacher is going to keep us here til midnight, but not so.  I&#8217;ve looked
in a concordance and I&#8217;ve marked all the passages, and now I propose that everyone of you take
your Bible in hand, and read for yourself with what ever translation you prefer, as we follow this
plain, simple, child-like search through God&#8217;s Word on our subject.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>

<p>We are going to begin at the very beginning of our New Testament, but before we do, there&#8217;s one
other thing we need to do to prepare our mind.  If you want to investigate any subject without
prejudice, we need to remove from our mind ALL that we think we know, or have heard from
men, or have imagined about our subject, and come to this investigation as if the subject were
absolutely a new one, which we have never heard a word about &#8220;baptism&#8221; in our life.   </p>
<br>
<p>Come with your mind like a sheet of blank paper, ready for God to write on it whatever you find
in His holy word.  Let&#8217;s propose then, that we have never before heard the word &#8220;baptism&#8221;
uttered before in our life. </p>

<p>&#160;When we come to the word, we will not turn to any Greek lexicon, </p>

<p>or any English dictionary, but we will pause, reflect upon it,</p>

<p>&#160;and see if the Book itself explains it to us; and if so, we will have God&#8217;s definition of it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Matthew ]</span></p>
<p>Now we begin at the first chapter of Matthew, and after reading the long list of names, and the
account of the birth of the Lord, and his childhood, </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Matthew 3:5 ]  </span></p>
<p>in the third chapter the writer introduces John the Baptist; and in verses 5 and 6 we read this:
&#8220;Then went out unto him Jerusalem and all Judea, and the region round about the Jordan, and
they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.&#8221;  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#8220;Baptized&#8221; underlined ]  </span></p>
<p>Why, there is a word here I&#8217;ve never seen before; I&#8217;ve never heard of it.  I wonder what it means&#8211;
that these people were <span style="text-decoration: underline">baptized</span> by that man in the river Jordan.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#8220;in the river Jordan&#8221; underlined ]</span></p>
<p>I would like to know what it means, but I believe I will let the New Testament itself explain it to
me.   I do not know what was done to those people by John, but can I learn anything about it in
this passage?   </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[ <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Picture of the River Jordan ]</span></p>
<p>Yes, they were baptized in the river Jordan; that tells me where it was done, and it tells me so
plainly that there can be no mistake about it.</p>
<br>
<p>So let us read on and see if we can learn more.   </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Matthew 3:11   &#8220;With water&#8221;   ]   </span></p>
<p>In verse 11, the same John says to his audience,</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#8220;with water&#8221; ]</span></p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that cometh after me is mightier than I;
whose shoes I am not worthy to bear.  He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.&#8221; 
Here is our strange word again, and this time John says, &#8220;I baptize you with <span style="text-decoration: underline">water.&#8221;</span>  Well, there is
another thing we learn about it&#8211; that water and not wine, or milk, or honey, or any other liquid,
but <span style="text-decoration: underline">water</span> is used in this ordinance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Matthew 3:13 ]</span></p>
<p>We read on, and in the same chapter, at verse 13 we read these words: &#8220;Then cometh Jesus from
Galilee to the Jordan unto John to be baptized of him.  But John would have hindered him, saying,
&#8216;I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?&#8217;  And Jesus said, &#8216;Suffer it now,
John, for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.&#8217;  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>&#8220;straightway from the water&#8221; ]</span></p>
<p>Then he suffered him.  And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway from the water.&#8221;</p>
<br>
<p>Well, we see what he did when he was through with the baptizing&#8211; he &#8220;went up straightway from
the water.&#8221;  But that is all.  It does not tell us what the baptizing was.  As regards the act itself
that is called <span style="text-decoration: underline">baptism</span>, we are still very much in the dark.   From this whole chapter we learn only
this&#8211; that when John baptized it was in the river Jordan; that he used&#8211; in some way, we don&#8217;t
know how&#8211; water; and that after Jesus was baptized he went up straightway from the water,
showing that he had been down in it, but that is all we learn, so we read on.</p>
<br>
<p>Our curiosity is aroused now, and chapter after chapter, page after page we turn, and we do not
find our word again it its literal sense, until we come to the last chapter of Matthew, </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Matthew 28:18-19 ]</span></p>
<p>and in 28:18-19 we read: Jesus came to them and spake to them, saying, all authority hath been

<p>Well, it is becoming interesting.  We can see it was a very solemn thing, and it is to be universal. 
We wonder more than ever about this subject.</p>

<p>We haven&#8217;t read but four verses in Mark til we read: &#8220;John came, who baptized in the wilderness
and reached the baptism of repentance unto the remission of sins.&#8221;  Here is another report of John
baptizing.  In Matthew we found that he baptized in the river Jordan.  Here, we read he baptized

<p>At verse 9: &#8220;It came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was

<p>Well, we learned from Matthew that he went up <span style="text-decoration: underline">from</span> the water, and now it says in Mark that he
came up <span style="text-decoration: underline">out of</span> the water.  So, Jesus, in being baptized,  had been down in the water.   It looks as
if baptism takes place down in the water, but we still don&#8217;t know what it is.</p>

<p>In the last chapter of Mark (16:15-16) verse 15 and 16 we read: &#8220;And he said to them: Go ye into
all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation.  He that believeth and is baptized shall

<p>Here is that same idea of its universality which we learned from Matthew, and here is an
additional thought connected with it, that &#8220;he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved;&#8221; and
that adds interest to our investigation.  Still, no light is thrown upon the act itself; and so we must
patiently go on with our reading.</p>

<p>In the third chapter of Luke we meet our strange word again, verse 3 </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Luke 3:3 ]</span></p>
<p>(Luke 3:3).  Speaking of John, the text says, </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Scripture ]</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He cometh to all the region round about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance unto the
remission of sins.&#8221;   It was not only where the Jordan ran through the wilderness then, but in &#8220;all
the region round about the Jordan&#8221; that John preached.  And here we learn that he preached the
&#8220;baptism of repentance unto the remission of sins.&#8221;   </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>repentance preceded  - ]</span></p>
<p>If it was a <span style="text-decoration: underline"><i>baptism of repentance</i></span>, a baptism which required a man to repent before he submitted
to it, and <span style="text-decoration: underline"><i>unto the remission of sins</i></span> it must have been a matter of supreme importance.  The
importance of this subject then grows upon us by the words used in connection with it, but no
light comes yet as to what the particular act itself was.  Remember, we are approaching our study
of this word as if we had never heard it before, and we want the New Testament itself to show us
its meaning, so we read on.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>John 3:22-23 ]</span></p>
<p>We read through Luke and into the gospel of John without additional light.  But in the 3<sup>rd</sup> chapter
of John, vs.  22 &amp; 23 we stumble upon it once again.  &#8220;After these things, Jesus came and his
disciples unto the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them and baptized.&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Jesus baptized ]</span></p>
<p>&#160;So we find from this that not only did John baptize, and not only did Jesus command his disciples
to go into all nation and baptize, but that Jesus himself baptized at one time.</p>
<br>
<p>&#8220;And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salem, because there was much water there and
they came and were baptized.&#8221;  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="color: #ff0000">[ <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>water ]</span></p>
<p>We learned in Matthew, also in Mark, that John used water in baptizing.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>

<p>Now we learn that when he left the Jordan, he went to Aenon near to Salem, because there was
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><i>much</i></span><i> </i>water there.  This shows that he wanted &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline"><i>much water</i></span>&#8221; with which to baptize.  But this is
still a vague expression, for a pitcher-full of water is much in comparison with a glass-full; a
barrel-full is much compared with a pitcher-full; and a river is much compared with any of our
vessels of water.  But we are learning very slowly some things with regard to the act itself, but we
must be patience when we are in search of the truth.</p>

<p>We read on through John without any further satisfaction, and into the book of Acts; and in the
2<sup>nd</sup> chapter of that book, and verse 41 we read,</p>

<p>&#160;In verse 38 Peter said to them, &#8220;Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus
Christ for the remissions of sins.&#8221;   And so we learn that the apostles did as Jesus told them&#8211; the
went preaching the gospel and requiring men to be baptized to become disciples.</p>

<p>We read on in the book of Acts, and in the 8<sup>th</sup> chapter we there find Philip in preaching the gospel
in Samaria, and &#8220;when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God
and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.&#8221;  Nothing there however
to explain the act itself.</p>

<p>In the same chapter, farther on, Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch are riding in the chariot together,
and Philip is preaching Jesus to him.  At verse 36 we read, &#8220;and as they went on their way, they
came to a certain water.&#8221;  </p>

<p>We have already learned that water was the element used.  &#8220;And the eunuch said, Behold, here is
water; what hindereth me to be baptized?  and he commanded the chariot to stand still, and they
both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, </p>

<p>the Spirit of the lord caught Philip away.&#8221;   We learn something additional from this.  We learn
that before the baptizing, the Ethiopian went down into the water, and that while he was down in
the water, the baptizing was done, and then he came up out of the water.</p>

<p>So we can see assuredly that the gospel was being preached as Jesus had directed it should be,
and that in order to become a disciple of Jesus, one was baptized.  But we don&#8217;t find any words in

conclusion can we reach than this, that he was buried in the water?   This then, at last, explains
what the act was. </p>

<p>It is unto remission of sins, so it  then coincides with a man having his sins forgiven just as Peter

<p>If this is all true my friends, it is the most solemn, interesting and precious command from the
Lord.  We can not overestimate the value of obeying this command from the Lord himself.  We
can not then speak of baptism as merely an external act which is not significant nor important, for
it symbolized the very death of our Lord himself; his death wherein he shed his blood for the
remission of our sins (Matthew 26:28) and it pictures our resurrection from the deadness of sin, to
a new resurrected life with Jesus.  Therefore, let my tongue praise the Lord, and let me not speak
despairingly of this divine command for all men to be baptized into the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>And if we could find the garden and know for sure where the garden tomb of Joseph of Armathea
could be found, </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>

<p>and if you could stretch yourself out in that tomb, in the very niche where Jesus lay, upon that
bare rock, and to have some friend roll a stone over the mouth of that cave and seal you there
where Jesus himself laid, you could imagine yourself buried with there with the Lord himself.  But
we cannot do that.   </p>

<p>And we don&#8217;t have to take a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to find that tomb to do that.   But in this act
of baptism we are allowed to do the next thing to it.  We are laid down in a grave of water in
obedience to the Lord&#8217;s command to be buried, or to be baptized, and as we have repented and
died to sin, </p>

<p>we are lifted out of that watery grave to start a new walk, a new life, just as our Lord started to
walk in a new way when he arose from the dead.   It is a sacred and blessed privilege.</p>

<p>When we consider this command in the light of the passages that we have read, we not only see
its connection with the burial and resurrection of our Lord, but we can see that it points to a new
life that we are to live in.  When one understand this, how can there be in the heart of any of us
repugnance toward this command?  Any feeling of disrespect toward it?  But only the feeling of a
most profound reverence for it, and for the God and Savior who appointed it?</p>

<p>Is there anyone here this service who desires to submit to this command?  My dear friend, you
cannot be baptized unless you believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God, our Savior.  You cannot
be buried with the Lord in that holy and solemn way, unless you have repented of your sins, and
have cast them behind you.   If you have done this; if it is within your heart today to confess your
faith in the Lord Jesus, then it is your privilege to be baptized into the name of the Father, and the
son, and the Holy Spirit; to receive the blessings that comes with obedience to the Lord, to
receive the forgiveness of sins, and to be enabled to walk in a new life&#8211; a life of righteousness,
peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>Does your heart long for this?  Do you hear the voice of the Lord calling you today?  Do you long
for those blessings to which he invites you?   Then my friend, I beg you to step out into one of the
aisles, to walk down and met me, and let the desire of your heart be make known; and confess the
glorious name of Jesus, and give your life to him in obedience to his command to be baptized!</p>
