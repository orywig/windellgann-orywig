What were the demons of biblical fame?
Where did they come from? What powers
did they possess? Why did they enter certain
persons and not others? Do they still possess
people today? These questions engage the
attention of thinking people.</span></p>

in the New Testament as the topic relates to
other matters of importance; it is therefore
incidental and so we are merely given
sufficient minimal information - information
necessary for the establishment of more
important truths. The subject of
demonology was thus obviously not an end
within itself in New Testament doctrine.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in"><span style="font-size: 18pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The question of demon origin is not
spelled out in the Scriptures. Several
theories have been advanced by respectable
Bible students, some of which, incidentally,
may be dismissed immediately.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in"><span style="font-size: 18pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>There are some six prominent theories
concerning the question of just who the
demons were</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in"><span style="font-size: 18pt"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Preview</span>: The major views are: (1) they
were the spirits of the offspring of angels
and women; (2) They were a pre-Adamic
race; (3) they are the spirits of those who
perished in the flood; (4) they are fallen
angels;  (5) they are the departed spirits of
wicked men which escaped Tartarus;  (6)
they are simply myths or superstitions, and
Jesus used such language to accommodate
their myths..</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in"><span style="font-size: 18pt">1. <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>One theory is that the demons were the
departed spirits of a mixed
angel-human race arising from the
intermarriage of angels with the
daughters of men. (Gen. 6:1-6)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -0.775in; margin-left: 0.775in"><span style="font-size: 18pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>a. <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The rationale for this theory
includes the following:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><span style="font-size: 18pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>o. <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>That in the book of Job, one reads
of the "sons of God" and how
they "came to present themselves
before Jehovah, and that Satan
also came among them". (Job.
2:6) The sans of God, therefore,
were angels --- not men.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><span style="font-size: 18pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>o. <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>That in the book of Genesis one
reads that "the sons of God", or
angels, saw the daughters of men
that they were fair; and they took
them wives of all they chose; and
further, the off springs of that
mongrel angel-human
relationship produced giants who
were of great renown. (Genesis
6:1-6).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><span style="font-size: 18pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>o. <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>That this conclusion agrees with a
statement from Jude, which reads;
"And angels that kept not their
own principality, but left their
proper habitation, he hath kept in
everlasting bonds under darkness
unto the judgment of the great
day", (Jude 6)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><span style="font-size: 18pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>o. <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>That in short, one aspect of
angel's leaving their own
principality was by the means of
their becoming flesh and
indulging in sex relations with
women.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><span style="font-size: 18pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>o. <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>That all of the mixed
angel-human race were evil and
thus reprobated by the all
powerful God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -0.775in; margin-left: 0.775in"><span style="font-size: 18pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>b. <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The case is however, that the angels
could no more transform themselves
into flesh (though they often
appeared as if in the flesh) than men
can transform themselves into
angels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -0.775in; margin-left: 0.775in"><span style="font-size: 18pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>c.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span> Christ clearly taught that angels are
sexless beings, incapable of such
unions (cf. Matt. 22: 30).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -0.775in; margin-left: 0.775in"><span style="font-size: 18pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>d. <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Further, while the expression "sons
of God" was applied to angels ---as
in the book of Job --- the case is that
the expression "sons of God" is also
applied to men. Example: The
apostle John wrote of Christ; "He
came to his oven, and they that were
his own received him not. But as
many as received him, to them gave
he power to become the sons of
God, even to them that believe on
his name" (KJV) John 1:11, 12.</span></p>

Seth, while the "daughters of men"

Cain.</span></p>

Jehovah that created the heavens,
the God that formed the earth and
made it, not a waste, that formed
it to be inhabited: I am Jehovah;
and there is none else". (Isaiah
45:18).</span></p>

Genesis which reads, "and the
earth was waste and void,
represented a time later than the
original creation of the earth.
(Genesis 1:2)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in; text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><span style="font-size: 18pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>o. <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>That the necessary implication is
that there had been a pre-Adamic
order of creation, that the order of
creation had become evil beyond
a point of return, and therefore,
God had plunged the earth into a
state of chaos as a means of
punishment against those evil
souls.</span></p>

Luke, "the unclean spirit when he

unclean spirit necessarily implies
that he had experienced physical
death by drowning, which in turn,
necessarily implies those demons

Note how Matthew interchanges the
terms: "... they brought unto him [Jesus]
many possessed with demons: and he
cast out the spirits with a word" (8:16).
Since Christ declared that "a spirit hath
not flesh and bones" (Lk. 24:39), it is
certain that demons were not physical
beings. Concerning their character,
demons are represented as malevolent
entities. They were unclean spirits and
evil - under the sway of him known as
"the prince of demons," i.e., Beelzebub,
Satan (cf. Matt. 12:24,43,45).</span></p>

possessing true knowledge (Mk. 1:24);
moreover they could exercise both
volition and locomotion when permitted
to do so (Matt. 12:44,45). Demon
possession frequently brought about
physical and/or mental illness (though
such illnesses were clearly distinguished
from the demons themselves - see
Matthew 4:24). Demoniacs were
sometimes smitten with dumbness (Matt.
9:32), blindness (Matt. 12:32),
convulsions (Mk. 9:18), epilepsy (Matt.
9:32-),- etc., and occasionally they were
endowed with superhuman strength (Mk.
5:4; Acts 19:16). The NT gives no
specific reasons why demons entered into
particular individuals; they inhabited men
(Matt. 9:32), women (Lk. 8:2), and even
children (Mk. 7: 30).</span></p>

demons were obviously under the
control of God ultimately (Lk. 10:17f),
why were they allowed to enter into
and to afflict those ancient folks?
Apparently, demon possession was
divinely permitted by God in order that
the supreme authority o f Christ might
be made manifest. As the Lord
revealed his control over nature (Mk.
4:30), disease (Mk. 1:12), material
things (Jn. 2:9), and even death(Jn.11:
44), so also must the Son of God
demonstrate his power over the spirit
realm. His power over unclean spirits
heralded his approaching reign - "If I
by the finger of God cast out demons,
then is the kingdom of God come upon
you" (Lk. 11: 20). The authority of
Jesus over evil spirits amazed the
Jews. They exclaimed: "What is this?
a new teaching! with authority he
commandeth even the unclean spirits,
and they obey him"(Mk.1: 27). The
Lord also empowered his disciples to
expel demons, and they did so (Lk.
10:17), except on one occasion when
their own lack of faith hindered their
efforts (cf. Mk. 9:28; Matt. 17:20).</span></p>

possession was more than epilepsy or

variety of afflictions. Each case was
different. We note the following
examples. The man of Gadara raved and
roared frightfully, was wild, fierce and
dangerous to himself and others. He had
supernatural strength, was insane, went
naked, and frequented the tombs and
deserted places. (Matt. 8:28-34; Mark
5:1-15.) One possessed of a demon was
blind and dumb. (Matt. 17:14-18.) Also it
made the child dumb and dashed him
down. He foamed at the mouth and
ground his teeth and pined away. (Mark
9:17-18.) A young girl had a spirit of
divination. (Acts 16:16-18.) A man with
a demon attacked and mastered two men.

in the NT is a person who was possessed or
seized by a demon or unclean spirit. There
were demoniacs in NT times (Matt. 4:24;
8:16; etc.);  the demons had the power over
the human body to cause dumbness (Matt.
9:32-33); blindness (Matt. 12:22); insanity
(Luke 8:26-36); personal injuries (Mark
9:18), and various physical defects and
deformities (Lk. 13:11-17). They caused a
maiden to divine (Acts 16:16); and their
titanic energy is seen in the supernatural
strength they could impart to the human
body (Luke 8:29). Their affinity for bodies
and deserted places is very evident (Rev.
18:2; Matt. 12:43-45; Mark 5:2-5).</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.312502in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in"><span style="font-size: 18pt">The distinction between demon-possession
and diseases ordinarily caused is clearly
made (Matt. 4:24; 8:16; 10:8; Mark 1:32,
34; 6:13; 16:17,18; Luke 4:40, 41; 9:1;
13:32; Acts 19:12). The results of
demon-possession are not exclusively
mental or nervous (Matt. 9:32, 33; 12:22).
They are distinctly and peculiarly mental in
two instances (Gadarene maniac, Mt. 8:28
and parallels, and Acts 19:13f). Epilepsy is
specified in one case (Matt. 17:15, ASV).
There is distinction made between
demonized and epileptic, and demonized
and lunatic (Matt. 4:24). There is a
distinction made between diseases caused
by demons and the same disease not so
caused (cf. Mt. 12:22; 15:30).</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.312502in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.312502in"><span style="font-size: 18pt">The demons possessed men (Mt. 8:28-34);
a daughter (Mt. 15:22-29); a child (Mark
9:17-27); and women (Mark 16:9; Luke
13:11f). Jesus commissioned the disciples to
cast out demons (Matt. 10:1), they did
(Luke 10:17-18); though falling on one
occasion it was because of lack of faith and
prayer (Mark 9:18, 28, 29). In the Great
Commission to all the world the apostles
were to cast out demons (Mark 16:15-17);
Peter cast them out (Acts 5:16); Philip cast
them out (Acts 8:7); and so did Paul (Acts
16:16-18; 19:12). The seven sons of Sceva
working as exorcists decided to use the
name of Jesus in adjuring the demons to
come out but were "mastered" and
"prevailed against" by the evil spirit so that
they fled out of that house naked and
wounded (Acts 19:13-16). A man, in a
highly figurative passage, is repossessed
because of sin and neglect on his part (Matt.
12:43-45). We cannot believe, however, that
all were possessed because of sin because of
the instances of the children.</span></p>

era of the early church (cf. I Cor. 13: 8ff)
, demon possession, and the
corresponding gift of expulsion, ceased.
Does it seem reasonable to assume that
since there is no gift of demon expulsion
available today, God would allow
demons to continue to enter and afflict
his human creatures? That would
certainly suggest an imbalance of power
and would put man at a great
disadvantage.</span></p>

were permitted to escape from the abyss
prior to the coming of Christ --- and in
time for men to be very aware of their
presence so that Christ and the apostles
could demonstrate by miracles their
power over the evil spirit world.</span></p>

today. He does not, though, work
miraculously. Just as God does not
continue to work miracles in this age, but
influences men by means of his Word

wields his power indirectly and
non-miraculously through various media.</span></p>

thoughts: (1) the existence of  demons
(and angels) prove there is a spirit world
thus denying that our world is only 
materialistic, (2) demons worshiped
Jesus and recognize his power and deity,
thus another testimony that Jesus is the
Son of God; (3) that evil beings are real;
(4) that Jesus (and those to whom he
gave authority) could cast the demons
out; (5) that Jesus broke the power of
Satan and demons. When the seventy
returned they said, "Lord, even the
demons are subject unto us in thy name."
Jesus said to them, "I beheld Satan fallen
as lightning from heaven." (Luke 10:17,
18.)</span></p>
