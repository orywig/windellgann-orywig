<p class=MsoTitle><strong>&#8220;Count It All Joy&quot;</strong></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>James 1:1-4</b></p>

<p>Introduction:</p>

<p>1. <strong><span style='color:red'>James 1:1</span> - </strong>Book written
to all Christians. </p>

<p>2. There is a Spanish Proverb that says - &quot;There is no home without a
hush.&quot;</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>a. Sooner or later every home knows heartache and trial
and sorry. Individuals also. But God's word says that these tears can be turned
into joy. </p>

<p>3. There are only three kinds of people in this world today: 1) those in the
middle of a trial; 2) those just coming out of a trial, 3) and people who are
about to go into a trial. </p>

<p>4. Trials &amp; Temptations come to all. This is not a sign you that
something is wrong with you.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>a. And how do we know? Because they came to Jesus. <strong><span
style='color:red'>Heb. 4:15</span>,</strong> <span style='color:maroon'>&quot;For
we have not a high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities,
but was in all points tempted [tried, or tested] like we are, yet without
sin.&quot;</span></p>

<p><strong><span style='font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:blue'>I.
FACT of Trials</span></strong><span style='font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>1. Not &quot;<em><b>if</b></em>&quot; but &quot;<em><b><span
style='color:maroon'>when</span></b></em>&quot; you fall. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>a. A Christian should expect trials, oppressions,
misunderstanding and rejection.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>b. If anybody tries to teach that the Christian
life is all sunlight and roses, they're teaching from an empty head and from a
closed Bible.</p>

<p>2. The Bible doesn't say you &quot;might&quot; fall into temptation, it says
you will.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>a. - Job was a blameless upright man who feared God
and turned away from evil. yet, in one day Job lost everything from family, to
finances, to fortune, to fitness, to friends.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>b. - Daniel was a man totally committed to God, who
prayed three times a day to the Lord. All he got for his praying was a free
trip to the lion's den.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>c. - Joseph was a man of unquestioned integrity,
decency, loyalty, and purity, who was thrown into prison for a crime he didn't
commit, without even a trial.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>d. - Paul, the greatest Christian - (2 Cor.
11:23-27)</p>

<p>3. &quot;<em><b><span style='color:maroon'>Divers</span></b></em>&quot;
temptation - </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>a. This is the Greek word we get
&quot;polka-dot&quot; from. Life is &quot;dotted&quot; with trials.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>b. The word means multi-colored, and multi-sized.
Trials come in all shapes, sizes, and colors. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>c. They may be affliction, sorrow, sickness,
physical trials, financial trials, psychological trials, spiritual trials. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br WP=BR1>
<strong><span style='font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:blue'>II.
FORM of Trials</span></strong><span style='font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>1. There are various kinds of temptations. Greek word for both &quot;<span
style='color:maroon'>trials</span>&quot; and &quot;<span style='color:maroon'>temptations</span>.&quot;
(Sometimes Greek is more precise than English, 4 Greek words of love, one
English word. ) Here we have two English words - Trials and Temptations (<span
style='color:red'>vs. 13</span>) - but the same Greek word. We must look at the
context.</p>

<p>2. A <u>trial</u> is a test sent by God. The <u>temptation</u> is a test
sent by Satan. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>a. <u>Trials</u> are give by God to help us learn
how to &quot;steadfast&quot;, <u>Temptations</u> are given by Satan to cause us
to stumble.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>b. Now God, with his test is aiming at your <u>maturity</u>,
Satan, with his test, is aiming at your <u>misery</u>.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br WP=BR1>
3. <strong><span style='color:red'>1 Peter 4:12</span> </strong><span
style='color:maroon'>&quot;Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery
trial which is to test you, as though some strange thing happened unto
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p>4. Now to be tempted, or tried, is not a sin. Jesus was tempted, but he
didn't sin.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Temptation is an enticement, an allurement, an
inducement to commit sin. These come from Satan, not for God. God does present
&quot;temptation&quot; to people - <strong><span style='color:red'>James 1:13.</span></strong><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><br

</span><strong><span style='font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
color:blue'>III. FALLING into Trials</span></strong><span style='font-size:
18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>1. <strong><span style='color:red'>Luke 10</span></strong> - In the story of
the &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; -</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>a. This man was walking along the road from
Jerusalem, and he<span style='color:maroon'> &quot;fell among thieves.&quot;</span>
He wasn't looking for thieves; he wasn't wanting to be robbed; but these
thieves were waiting in hiding and they ambushed him.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>b. The man fell &quot;<u>suddenly</u>,&quot; &quot;<u>seriously</u>&quot;
&quot;<u>savagely</u>&quot;</p>

<p>2. Your next phone call may be the greatest trial of your life. Someone on
the other end will tell you something that you are not prepared for. You will
&quot;fall&quot; into these things.<o:p></o:p></p>

color:blue'>IV. FACING of Trials</span></strong><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>1. &quot;<em><b>Count it all joy</b></em>&quot; . . .<span style='color:
red'>v.2</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>a. James was not sado-masochist who delighted in
being hurt. He was not saying you ought to enjoy trials, or that trials are
here for a joy. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>b. He knew &quot;no chastening seems to be joyful
for the present, but grievous.&quot; <strong><span style='color:red'>Heb.
12:11.</span></strong></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>c. This does not mean to &quot;grin and bear
it&quot;, but to become an &quot;overcomer&quot;</p>

<p>2. James is not talking about relishing pain and sorrow - <span
style='color:maroon'>&quot;Christ, who for the joy set before him, endured the
cross</span>.&quot; Christ did not relish the cross. But he looked to its end,
its accomplishment.</p>

<p>3. To <em><b>&quot;</b></em><em><b><span style='color:maroon'>count it</span></b></em><span
style='color:maroon'>&quot;</span> is a word that literally means to lead, or
look ahead.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>a. We are to &quot;look forward&quot; to what will
be accomplished when we have overcome!</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>b. Christ looked ahead of the cross and saw the
lives that would changed, the homes that would saved, the good work that would
be done in his name, and how all this would glorify the Father.</p>

<p><strong><span style='font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:blue'>V.
FRUIT of Trials</span></strong><span style='font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>1. <span style='color:red'>Verse 3 </span>- &quot;<em><b>knowing</b></em>&quot;
that the &quot;<em><b>trying</b></em>&quot; or testing of your faith.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>a. This is somewhat like a test in school. Some
pass and some fail. </p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>1) <u>Illustration</u>. Boy to professor, &#8220;I got a
&quot;zero&quot;, I don't think I deserve this!&#8221;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Professor: &#8220;Neither do I, but it's the lowest grade I
had.&quot; </p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>2) Does our <em><b><u>faith</u></b></em> pass, or
fail - when it is tested?</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>b. The purpose of a test is two-fold. Tests reveals
the &quot;<u>strength</u>&quot; of your knowledge; and it measures the &quot;<u>weakness</u>&quot;
of your knowledge.</p>

<p>2. You may think because you come to church every Sunday, sing praises, give
money, take notes, and walk piously, that your faith is strong. But only
trouble will tell. You see, faith not only must stand the test of <strong>time</strong>,
it must stand the test of <strong>trouble</strong>.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>a. <strong><span style='color:red'>Prov. 24:10</span>
</strong>says <span style='color:maroon'>&quot;If you faint in the day of
adversity, your strength is small</span>.&quot; Or we could paraphrase it this
way, &quot;If your faith fails you when trouble comes, your faith was
weak.&quot;</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>b. Some one made the statement, &quot;You can tell
how great a Christian is by what it takes to stop him.&quot;</p>

<p>3. This &quot;testing&quot; is also the word that refers to the refining of
Gold. Gold is sent though scorching fire. But it has nothing to fear from the
fire, because the fire simply burns off all the impurities and all the dross.</p>

<p>4. The Fruit of Trials - <span style='color:red'>vs. 3</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>a. <em><b>Patience</b></em> - endurance</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>1) Not talking about needlework, or a 500 piece puzzle,
- but to bear up under trial, under pressure</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>2) <u>Illustration</u>: A man had a Grandfather
clock and he felt sorry for the clock because it had a weight on it. that
weight in that box was always pulling down, the clock was asked to bear a heavy
load. The man said, &quot;Oh clock you have been holding this weight so long I
am going to remove it and let you rest.&quot; He took it off and the
Grandfather Clock said, &quot;Don't take that weight from me, that is what
keeps me going.&quot; The trials and tests of life are there for your
endurance, to keep you going, trusting, praying, and to keep you leaning upon
God.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>b. <em><b>Perfect</b></em> - maturity</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>1) &quot;<span style='color:maroon'>Perfect</span>&quot;
here doesn't mean &quot;sinless&quot; - a &quot;perfect rose&quot; not sinless.
but one complete in all its beauty.</p>

<p>2) The scripture speaks of <span style='color:maroon'>&quot;the captain of
our salvation was made perfect through suffering.&quot;</span> Christ not not
&quot;<span style='color:maroon'>made</span>&quot; sinless, he always was
&quot;sinless.&quot; But he came to complete his task, to finish it, to bring
it to fulfillment, completion.</p>

<p>3) &quot;<em><u><span style='color:maroon'>Teleious</span></u></em>&quot; -
complete, mature. For example, an oak tree is the &quot;teleious&quot; of an
acorn. It is the completion, perfection of an acorn. &quot;A might oak and a
little acorn. So when you are feeling discouraged and a little blue take a look
at a might oak and see what a nut can do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br WP=BR1>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>1. <strong><span style='color:red'>I Cor. 10:13</span></strong> - whether a
Trial or Enticement from Satan to sin, here is a promise for you -</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><u>First</u>: if &quot;<span style='color:maroon'>temptation</span>&quot;
came from God, we'd have an excuse for sin. Because God is all powerful. But
&quot;<span style='color:maroon'>temptation</span>&quot; is not from God -<span
style='color:red'> James 1:13</span>.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><u>Second</u>: men try to find excuse for their
sin: There are basically 3 excuses we give:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Notice the three &quot;<em><b>BUTS</b></em>&quot;
in this verse:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>a. &quot;My temptation is different, <strong>unique</strong>&quot;
- &quot;<span style='color:maroon'>. . . such as is common to man&quot;</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>b. &quot;My trial / temptation is <strong>too
strong</strong>!&quot; - &quot;<span style='color:maroon'>. . . not tempted
above that you're able . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>c. &quot;My trial/ temptation - <strong>no way out</strong>!&quot;
- &quot;<span style='color:maroon'>. . . make a way to escape . . </span>.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

2. <u>Illustration</u>: A man watched a beautiful butterfly trying to emerge
from a cocoon. He watched as this transformation was taking place, and thinking
he would help, took his razor sharp pen knife and slit the side of this silk
cocoon. The butterfly just flopped out and fell over and lay there and feebly
beat its wings a couple of times and died! God had a plan for that butterfly it
was meant to struggle against that cocoon and to push and push and develop its
circulation in its wings, and to strengthen itself from the struggle and to
prepare it for flight. But without the struggling, it could not fly.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br WP=BR1>
3. <u>Illustration</u>: William Cowper - a great hymn writer. But before his
conversion there was a time when he was very discouraged. There is a story that
is told, almost funny. He became so discourage he planned to commit suicide. He
got an old gun, pointed it at himself, but he couldn't get it to fire. He got a
rope and tied himself to the chandelier and tried to hang himself and the rope
broke. He decided to take poison and he did, but he got well. He finally
considered to jump from the London bridge into the Thames River. He got a
friend to drive him there one evening in his horse and buggy. But in the thick
London fog they couldn't find the River, and finally ended up back home. Went
upstairs, read his Bible. and eventually wrote the hymn: &quot;God moves in a
mysterious way, his wonders to perform. He plants his footsteps in the sea and
rides upon the storm. Ye fearful saints fresh courage take, the Clouds ye so
much dread are big with mercy and shall break blessings on your head.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br WP=BR1>
4. <u>Illustration</u>: I read about a young Christian who was trying to get
into the peach growing business. He had worked hard, invested everything he had
in a peach orchard, which had blossomed beautifully. But then a frost came, and
it destroyed his entire crop. He didn't go to church the next Sunday, nor the
next, nor the next.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>a. So the preacher went to see him to find out why.
The young fellow said, &quot;Preacher, I'm not coming to church any more. Do
you think I can worship God who cares so little for me that he would let a
frost kill all of my peaches?&quot;</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>b. The preacher replied kindly and wisely,
&quot;Son, God love you better than he loves your peaches. You see, God
understands that while peaches can grow without frost, Christians cannot grow
without trials. God is not in the business of growing peaches; He's in the
business of growing Christians.&quot;</p>
