Introduction:

1.   In the prophetical words of David, "This is the day that the Lord hath made,
     let us rejoice and be glad in it."  And we do rejoice for this good audience, for
     the fellowship of this occasion, for the opportunity to be with you and for you
     to be here for this hour of worship to God.

2.   We pray that the service will be well pleasing in the sight of God, and that
     this study of the Word of the Lord will be beneficial to all.

     a.   We hope that there may be those in this audience who will come in
          obedience to the word of the Lord at the close of the study and as we
          sing in a few moments the song of invitation.

3.   In John 13:34,35, Jesus said, "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye
     love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another, By this
     shall all men know that ye are my disciples. if he have love one to another."

     a.   In First Corinthians 8:12 Paul says, "But when ye sin so against the
          brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ."

     b.   From these verses of scriptures we talk about the right attitude and
          conduct toward brethren.

     c.   From the words of John 13 we notice that the Lord instructs the
          disciples to have the proper love.  And failure to do so would be sin,
          not only against the brother, but in the sight of God.

4.   In First Corinthians 8: for us to cause a brother to stumble by reason of the
     violation of his conscious, would not only be a sin against the brother, but
     would be a sin against Jesus Christ.

     a.   There is a lot of sin among the people of God.  In  1 John 1:8 "If we
          say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in
          us."   Verse 10, "If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a
          liar, and his word is not in us."

     b.   Many of the sins that are practiced by those who are the children of
          God are sins committed against one another.  

     c.   Those,  many times, are sins of disposition and attitude, and such as
          those things that we do that indicate the wrong attitude and conduct
          toward the brethren.


<font color = blue>I.   LET BROTHERLY LOVE CONTINUE</font color = blue>

     By way of beginning our study we want to think about some of the ways
     whereby we sin one against another with the wrong attitude, the wrong
     disposition.

A.   In the first place we sin against our brethren when we 
     
     FORSAKE THEM IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE.


1.   You remember the story in Luke 10 of a man who journeyed from Jerusalem
     to Jericho and fell among thieves.  He was beaten and robbed and left for
     dead beside the road.

     a.   We notice in the story that a Priest and the Levite came by that way,
          but passed on the other side of the road.  They forsook a brother in the
          time of need.

2.   In Matthew 26 when the Lord was in the garden of Gethsamane, as he was in
     great agony and in great sorrow, the multitude came to take him.  

     a.   The disciples in an oath said they would defend the Lord, but along in
          the 56th verse we read that his disciples forsook him and fled.

3.   When the apostle Paul was in Rome, a prisoner in Caesar's court, and finally
     was brought to trial, he wrote unto Timothy later to say, 2 Timothy 4:16,  
     "16 At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray
     God that it may not be laid to their charge."[KJV].  

     a.   Brethren forsook Paul in the time of trouble.  And we always sin
          against our brother when we forsake him in the time of trouble.

4.   Case in Tennessee, member of Church worked in butcher shop.  One day
     when cutting meat a man came in angrily behind him, when he turned around
     the man accidentally ran into the knife and sustained a cut on the arm.  The
     Christian was took to court by the injured man.  When the day of trial came,
     and the judge came into the court room, he was astonished and asked the
     clerk, who are all these people here?  The clerk answered, this man is a
     Christian, and these are his brethren here to testify for this man and to stand
     by him.

     a.   Sometimes we say that we have all the problems that we can afford of
          our own, why bother about the problems of another.  

     b.   And sometime we may let a person go down the way and become
          discouraged, and become unfaithful to God, and lose his soul after a
          while, because we forsook him in the time of trouble.  

5.   Paul said in Galatians 6:2,   "2 Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil
     the law of Christ. " [KJV].  

6.   In the words of Romans 12:5,   "5 So we, being many, are one body in
     Christ, and every one members one of another. " [KJV].   

     a.   Because we are member one of another, and because we should bear
          one another's burdens, let us never forsake a brother in the time of
          trouble.



B.   But we sin against our brethren in these day 

     WHEN WE FAIL TO PRAY FOR THEM.


1.   Paul in his writings unto those in Rome, said in Romans 15:30-31, Brethren,
     pray for me that I may be delivered from the unbelieving Jews.

2.   And those in Thessalonica in the letter he penned, Brethren, pray that the
     word of God may have free course and be glorified even as it is with you and
     that we may be delivered from wicked and sinful men.  (2 Thess. 3:1,2).

3.   The word of divine truth taught in Hebrews 13:18, Brethren pray for us. 
     And in his word to the Philippians (1:4) Paul reminded them how he had
     always remembered them in his prayers to God.

     a.   How long has it been since you prayed for the brethren?  Not just the
          sick in general and the missionaries in general, but specifically but for
          brethren and mentioned them by name?  

     b.   We need to pray one for another lest we be found in the sight of God to
          sin one against another.

4.   When Saul sinned against the Lord and was shown his sin by the prophet
     Samuel, he begged Samuel to pray for him.  And Samuel's response was:  1
     Samuel 12:23,   "23 Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin
     against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good
     and the right way: " [KJV].  


C.   And we need to remember that also we have the wrong attitude and
     disposition toward our brethren 

     WHEN WE FAIL TO SET BEFORE THEM THE PROPER
     EXAMPLE.


1.   We need to set the right example.  Matt. 18:6 Let us not cause a little one to
     stumble.  

2.   And to Timothy (1 Tim. 4:12) he said "Be thou an example for the believer,
     v.16 Take heed unto thy self.  

     a.   So in taking heed to ourselves, we endeavor to be the right kind of an
          example.

3.   In Acts 20:28, concerning the elders of the church he says, that they should
     take heed unto themselves that they might always be the right example.

4.   The word of truth is emphasized in Romans 14:19, that we should follow
     after things which make for peace and things whereby we may edify one
     another.  

     a.   Being the proper example enters into the matter, being the light of the
          world, and the salt of the earth is necessary to being the right kind of
          example.

     b.   Are we are the kind of example that we ought to be even to our
          children?  Are we the kind of examples that we ought to be for the
          young members of the church?  

     c.   To the young people, to the new-born in the family of God?  

          i.   Many a soul has been discouraged because they came to the
               service and saw some of the older members not interested
               enough and concerned enough about the cause of Christ to be
               present at some of the services of the church.

5.   There may be someone over yonder in the Judgment, that may be found
     among the lost, who will say to the Lord, Had it not been for the unconcerned
     and disinterest of some of the brethren I would have been more faithful in the
     service of God.  

     a.   We need to consider the need of setting the right example lest we sin
          against our brother.


D.   But there is brought to our consideration the fact that we sin against our
       brethren 

     WHEN WE FAIL TO RESTORE THEM.

1.   In Hebrews 10:24,   "24 And let us consider one another to provoke unto
     love and to good works: " [KJV].    

2.   Paul write in the Galatian letter Galatians 6:1,   "Brethren, if a man be
     overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit
     of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.  " [KJV].  

3.   When a child is lost out in the woods we go and search, we call in the
     neighbors and the friends and the people of the community, of the county, and
     of the state become alarmed, and they search diligently, and earnestly for the
     child.  

     a.   But when a soul is lost to the cause of Jesus Christ, fallen by the
          wayside, what efforts do we make, sometimes there is not any effort
          made.  

     b.   And sometimes four or five months later, someone inquires, "Where is
          so and so," as though they had just now begun to miss them.

4.   Let us keep in mind the fact that we sin against a brother when we do not
     work to restore that soul.


E.   And we sin today against a brother 

     WHEN WE REFUSE TO FORGIVE HIM.


1.   For the Bible tells us, (Luke 17:3-4),   "... If thy brother trespass against
     thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. 4 And if he trespass against
     thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee,
     saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him. " [KJV].
     

2.   We need to be forgiving for as the Master taught in Matthew 6:14,   "14 For
     if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive
     you: " [KJV].    

3.   The word of the Lord tells us in Matthew 18 (vs. 18-35) that the kingdom of
     heaven is like a King taking account of his servants.  

     a.   One owed 10,000 talents, about $7,500,000 and another 100 pense. 
          But the great King forgave them both.

4.   The Lord of glory has forgiven us, for that which we could not be forgiven, he
     has forgiven us our sins.  

     a.   And yet today when people sin against us, sometimes we are prone not
          to forgive them.  

     b.   May God help us to realize the importance of forgiving one another.

5.   There were some ladies that were having trouble, one of them was accusing
     the other, and the elders of the church called these ladies in, and the matter
     was brought up, and one lady that was accused, said, "Well, I never knew
     that I was doing that, I never knew that the other woman felt this way, I am as
     sorry as I can be, and I beg of you to forgive me.  

     a.   You know they had to talk a long time before that other woman would
          ever say that she would forgive this lady.  

     b.   And about two months later she called on the telephone and talking to
          the preacher, she said, "you know old sister so and so" and she began
          to go over that same old story again.  

     c.   And the preacher said, Lady, wait a minute, was not that matter
          corrected back yonder.

6.   You know sometimes we say that we have forgiven and we bring it up again
     and again.  It is like burying the hatchet and leaving the handle out of the
     ground, so we can grab it when we find an opportune moment.

7.   We sin against our brethren when we refuse to forgive them.  Have you
     forgiven your brethren? 

     a.    We sin against them when we fail to restore them.  What effort have
          we made to restore the lost?

     b.   We sin against the brethren when we fail to set the proper example
          before them.

     c.   We sin against our brother when we fail to pray for him.

     d.   And we sin against him when we forsake him in the time of need.

F.   We sin against them 

     WHEN WE DO THEM BODILY HARM, 

          or to steal from them, to hurt them physically, or when we engage in
          the matter of       keeping from them the things that are
                              necessary for their physical good.

1.   We sin against our brethren when we fail to preach the gospel to them.  

     a.   For in Matthew 28: verse 20 Jesus said that we should teach the
          baptized to observe those things he had taught.  

2.   We sin against our brethren when there is hatred, malice, envy in our heart,
     when there is slander, when there is gossiping, when there is an effort to hurt
     the character and the reputation of others.

3.   And before we speak let us ask, Will it hurt the character or the reputation of
     my brother or sister to say these things, will it be to their good to their hurt.  

     a.   We want to do today the things that will make us acceptable in the
          sight of God and these are matters that need to be taken into
          consideration.


<font color = blue>II.  CONSIDER THIS  MATTER  "LOVE"</font color = blue>

     And so great trouble comes today in the fact that we somewhere along the
     way fail to have the proper love, one for another.  

     And the right attitude and conduct toward the brother is the attitude of love.  
     
     We spend some of our time now talking about this matter of LOVE.


A.   The New Commandment -- "To Love One Another."

1.   In John 13:34, 35,   "34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love
     one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. " "35 By
     this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to
     another. " [KJV].  

     a.   Jesus said, A new commandment.  It was new only in its scope and its
          magnitude.  And the badge of discipleship is this kind of brotherly love. 
          

2.   Jesus said in John 15:12,   "12 This is my commandment, That ye love one
     another, as I have loved you. " [KJV].    

3.   And the word says in Heb. 13:1, "Let brotherly love continue."  

     a.   That means that love must exists and it must be permitted to go on.

     b.   And we have to do something to have this brotherly love.  

     c.   It doesn't come automatically.  

     d.   We do nothing, and the love will soon vanish away.  But we have to
          keep that love as it ought to be.

4.   In the words of Romans 13:8, Paul said,   "Owe no man anything, but to love
     one another," 

     a.   You may pay the debts that you have made along the pathway of live,
          but there is one debt that is never paid, and it is the debt of love.  

     b.   We'll owe that debt to the last day that we live upon this earth.  

     c.   He says, for this love  thou shall not kill, thou shall not steal, thou
          shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not covet, thou shalt not
          commit adultery, and if there be any other thing that is comprehended
          in the saying, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. (Rom. 13:9)

5.   If we had the right love in the world, no man would take another man's wife. 
     

     a.   If we had the right love we would not say anything that would be false
          about another.  

     b.   If we had the right love in our hearts we would not covet the goods of
          another though he had ten-thousand times the goods that we have.

6.   And he says finally in the matter, that love worketh no ill to his neighbor, for
     love is the fulfilling of the law.  

     a.   If we love one another, we never possess the attitude, "I'll get even
          with that person if it is the longest day I live."  

     b.   We need the right love among brethren.

7.   Solomon said in Proverbs 18:19,   "19 A brother offended is harder to be
     won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle."
     [KJV].    

     a.   It takes longer sometime to win a brother, than it would to win a
          fortified city.  It takes more tact to win a brother, than it would to win a
          fortified city.  

     b.   And as the castles of long ago we saw bars in the concrete, so are the
          difficulties that arise among brethren.  Bars must be broken down and
          it is hard to get to the heart where love ought to be.

B.   What Love Is NOT:

     As we think about this matter of Love, let us consider what it is NOT:

1.   Brotherly love is not like instinctive love, or the love that a mother may have
     for it's young.  

     a.   For in brotherly love there is a greater affection than that which an
          animal has.

2.   Sometimes people have thought about brotherly love as a patriotic love, but it
     is bigger than that.  

3.   Sometimes people have thought about this love as a partisan love, many
     people love a party because of their own personal gain, or because of
     something that they want to see another gain.  

     a.   But this that is called brotherly love is greater than that.

     b.   And it is greater than the love that some people claim to have for their
          relatives and their friends.  

          i.   For sometimes we are glad to see the friends come and we are
               soon glad that they have gone.  And that is not characteristic of
               brotherly love.

4.   As we think about this love, neither is this love like that a man may have for a
     brotherhood, or some lodge, or organization upon this earth.

C.   But now we interested in What Brotherly Love Really Is: 

1.   The disciples of the Lord needed a lesson on brotherly love.  

     a.   In the upper room they did not come to wash one another's feet.  

     b.   And the Lord washed their feet, to teach them that they needed to be
          humble, for because they would not wash one another's feet they
          evidenced the lack of love for one another.  

     c.   And it was in that upper room that the Lord told them that by the
          proper love between his disciples shall the world know that ye are my
          disciples.  

     d.   What kind of a picture does the world get today from the members of
          the family of God?  That is a question that ought to be of concern to
          everyone of us.

2.   When we see a mother that takes the food from her own mouth and gives it to
     the mouth of a child we think about love.  

     a.   When we see a mother sit there by the bed of a sick child all night and
          cares and nurses for that child and brings it back to good health, we
          know that there has been a great love.

     b.   When we see a man that loves his companion so in this world, that he
          is willing to die even for her, we see a great love.  

     c.   And this is the magnitude of love the Lord wants to exist among
          brethren.  The word of the Lord says that Christ loved the church and
          gave himself for it.  That kind of love.

3.   For in 1 John 3:16 "Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid
     down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren."
     KJV

D.   What Brotherly Love Will Do...

1.   We recognize that brotherly love is that love that provides for the physical
     needs of man.  

     a.   In the church in Jerusalem when there was a need, the people arose to
          meet the need.  

     b.   They sold their goods and their house and they brought the price and
          laid it at the apostle's feet.  

     c.   When the Grecian widows were neglected in daily care, they appointed
          men, and they went about to supply the need.

2.   Brotherly love supplies the spiritual need as well as the physical need. 

     a.    For daily in the temple and in every house they cease not to teach and
          to preach Jesus Christ.  

     b.   They continued in the Apostle's teaching in fellowship ... Acts 2:42.

     c.   The spiritual needs were fulfilled as well as the physical.

     d.   And after that, when there is the right love there is the concern about
          the person spiritually.  

          i.   That is the reason that we go to a brother who has done us
               wrong and say, You have done me wrong.  Or you have done
               this that ought not to be and try to make the matter right.  Matt.
               18:15-18.

3.   And we notice in the study of 1 Cor. 8:10 that Paul writes about wounding
     the conscience of another (vs. 10-13)...  1 Corinthians 8:12,   "12 But when
     ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin
     against Christ. " [KJV].    

     a.   When he says we are invited to sit down in someone's house to eat
          meat and someone comes in and says this is offered unto idols, eat it
          not for conscience sake, not of thine own, but of thy brother.  For we
          must not cause that man to stumble.
     
     b.   And when we refrain from those things that cause that weak brother to
          stumble we are evidencing the right love.

4.   The Jews had it, for we read in Acts 2:44-45,   "44 And all that believed
     were together, and had all things common; 45 And sold their possessions
     and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. " [KJV].    

5.   Not only did they express their love on that occasion, but in Hebrews 10:32-33,   "32 But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were
     illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; 33 Partly, whilst ye were
     made a gazing stock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye
     became companions of them that were so used. " [KJV].    

     a.   Brotherly love caused those people to stand up and say, "I'm a
          Christian,  and  I stand with these that you are persecuting rather than
          go off yonder and hide.

6.   Paul said remember them that were in bonds as bound with them.  

     a.   And only when we have the proper regard and concern one for another
          do we are dare put ourselves in their places.  

     b.   For the right love causes us to weep with them that weep, and mourn
          with them that mourn, and rejoice with them that rejoice.  

     c.   We need this love to fulfill the commandment of the Lord.

7.   And this love does not exist today among the brethren of the church  as it
     ought.  

     a.   There are multitudes of places that people can go and find a lack of it.

E.   Brotherly Love is Needful Today...

1.   It is needful today among brethren, because the Lord died for the other fellow
     the same as did for us. 

     a.   1 Cor. 8, we need this love today because of the fact that God loves us. 
          

     b.   John said, "Let us love one another, for love is of God.  And as one
          that loveth God is born of God, and knoweth God."

2.   And we need this love because of the magnitude of  God's  love for us.  

     a.   I John 4:11 says that we love him because he first loved us.

3.   We need this love so that we may save our own souls.  

     a.   1 John 3:14,   "14 We know that we have passed from death unto life,
          because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth
          in death. " [KJV].   We need the right love one for another.

4.   Did you know that this love is required in the Bible to be a means of covering
     a multitude of sins.  Peter say, 1 Peter 4:8,   "8 And above all things have
     fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of
     sins.  " [KJV].  

     a.   Many things today build up in front of us a great mountains when really
          mole hills would not exist if we have the right love.  For love will cover
          a multitude of sins.

5.   And the love is important for us because Paul says in Colossians 2:2,   "2
     That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto
     all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of
     the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ; " [KJV].    

     a.   Love knits us together, not just seated  together, but it means we are
          closely stitched and bound together.  

     b.   When you see brethren falling apart today when a problem arises in
          their midst, you see where the right love doesn't exist.


E.   We know that this LOVE is importance because of what the scripture
     says about it.

1.   1 Corinthians 13:1-6 ,   " Though I speak with the tongues of men and of
     angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling
     cymbal. " [KJV].   . . .  

     a.   We need to have the right love.  It will cover sins, it will cause us to
          overlook a lot of things that otherwise we would not. 

     b.   It will bind us together, it will make us united in the cause of the Lord
          and Saviour Jesus Christ.

2.   And as we think about this Love, Paul says, that we should love without
     hypocrisy.  He says that we should be kindly affectioned one toward another,
     in brotherly love, in honor, preferring one another.  

     a.   The right love causes us to put the other fellow ahead of our selves.

3.   And the word of the Lord tells us also to consider the problems and distress
     of another person.  1 Peter 1:22,   "22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in
     obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see
     that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: " [KJV].     

     a.   Love with a pure heart, love without hypocrisy, and we need to love
          men in deed and in truth.  

4.   1 John 3:17,   "17 But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother
     have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth
     the love of God in him?" [KJV].     

     a.   We have to do something to show that we have love.  

     b.   The same as we must do to show that we have faith, it is not enough to
          say that I love my brother, we must prove that by our actions.

5.   We consider the fact then that this love is needful today, to be demonstrated
     for forbearance, by longsuffering.  Paul say in Colossians 3:13,   "13
     Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a
     quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.  " [KJV].    

     a.   The right love demands that we be forebearing, that we refrain from
          going and saying the things that would cause offense.  

     b.   The right love demands that we be patience, that we be longsuffering,
          that we hold our tongues and our tempers, that we be swift to hear, and
          slow to speak, and slow to wrath.  

     c.   It demands that we be tender-hearted, and this means that we should be
          meek, that we should be gentle, that we should be calm.  

     d.   2 Peter 1:7,   "7 And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly
          kindness charity. " [KJV].    

     e.   Eph. 4:32 emphasized that we should be tenderhearted.


F.   We need to think about love; we need to think about how
     God demands a love for our enemies
           as well as our brethren.

1.   Romans 12:17,   "17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things
     honest in the sight of all men. " [KJV].  
          Romans 12:19-20,   "19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but
          rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I
          will repay, saith the Lord. 20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed
          him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals
          of fire on his head. " [KJV].  

2.   How do we love our enemy?

     a.   David loved Saul, even though Saul was seeking his life.  

     b.   David cut off Saul's skit, but would not harm him.  

     c.   Saul said, Thou art more righteous than I.  

     d.   David would not lift his hand against the Lord's anointed.


G.   Love demands unity among brethren.

1.   When I stop and think about what this love demands, not only love for our
     enemy, but it demands unity among brethren.  

     a.   We need unity in the world today as much as about anything we need
          along with brotherly love.
......
2.   Growth takes unity.  

     a.   There cannot be dissatisfied and disgruntled members of the church
          and have the cause of Jesus Christ to grow.  

     b.   Then if we have the right love one for another then we will grow 

          i.   Where there is a problem or a difficulty or where there is
               something where this is a dislike then we will talk that matter
               over and we will try to find some common ground for some
               agreement that there may be peace and harmony, and if we do
               not succeed the first time we will try again.  

          ii.  And we will not give up even the second time.

3.   There is too much at stake in the cause of the Lord and Master in a
     community for there to be anything but brotherly love and unity.  

     a.   Paul said in Philippians 2:2,   "2 Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be
           like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. "
          [KJV].   

     b.   Ephesians 4:2-3,   "2 With all lowliness and meekness, with
          longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; 3 Endeavoring to keep
          the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. " [KJV].  

4.   In order to keep the unity in the bond of peace, we need love.


IV.  Some Examples of Love

     I want you to think about some examples of love.

1.   Moses back yonder left the courts of Pharaoh with all its riches and
     compensations, because he loved his brethren.
     
2.   When we think about love, we need to think about Jonathan, who loved
     David with all his soul.  

     a.   Their hearts were knit together as one.  That is the kind of love God
          wants.
     
3.   We need to think about that scene in the land of Egypt, when the brothers of
     Joseph came one day to get grain, and he fills their bags full, and with their
     money... and as he fights to hold back tears as he sees his brother Benjamin.  

4.   His love as they sit at meat; and he cannot bear to see them go, and put a
     silver cup in Benjamin's sack.  

     a.   They all come back.  

     b.   We see the love of Judah who had made himself a surety for Benjamin.

     c.   This kind of Brotherly love is needed today.

5.   And in the New Testament we see the love in Acadia and Macedonia, who
     gave to the needs of their brother in Christ in need in Jerusalem and Judea.
     
6.   To have the love and care that John showed for Gaius, in 3 John 2.
     
7.   Paul when he leaves the leaders of Ephesus, Acts 20:37-38,   "37 And they
     all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him, 38 Sorrowing most of
     all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And
     they accompanied him unto the ship." [KJV].    

     a.   How they all loved and prayed for him.

8.   See Paul on the coast of Phoenicia, and in Caesarea where the Christian met
     him and the women and children crying, and the men begging Paul not to go
     on to Jerusalem.  

     a.   This is brotherly love that we ought to have one for another.

9.   Then we see John as the grey-haired apostle nearing the age of 100.  

     a.   After he is brought from the isle of Patmos back to Ephesus where he
          had penned the words in the book of Revelation.  

     b.   He is old and feeble because of his many years and the brethren bring
          him into the assembly on a bed, and the men say, 

     c.   Brother John can you give us a word of advice that would be good for
          the church.  And John said, "Brethren, love one another." 

     d.   And they said, Bro. John, could you give us some more words of
          advice that we be helpful for us.  And John said, "Little children, love
          one another."  

     e.   And they said, Bro. John, isn't there anything else that you can tell us
          that would help when distress arise and meet the problems along the
          way of life?"  And John says, "Little children, love one another."

CONCLUSION

1.   Do we love each other the way that we ought?  

     a.   Eternity depends upon this matter as well as upon other matters.  

2.   You need and I need to examine our lives and see if we have the proper love
     for the brethren.  

     a.   If we do, Let Brotherly love continue.  

     b.   If we don't, let us begin making every effort to strengthen this bond
          that ties our hearts together.

3.   What a love we have in Christ, if you are not in Christ, come to him.
