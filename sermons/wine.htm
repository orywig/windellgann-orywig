<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Introduction:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	It is alleged that Christ  not only drunk fermented wine but that in his first miracle
at the wedding in Cana he created it in great abuandance and that he also gave it to His
disciples at the Last Supper.  There are even some Christian who believe that Jesus was a
moderate drinker of fermented wine and that the teachings of the gospel show it is all
right to drink alcholic wine in moderation.  Now, the reason for some wanting to believe
this is simple.  The example and teaching of our Lord is the standard for Christian belief
and practice.  If Christ made, commended and used fermented wine, then there can hardly
be anything intrinsically wrong with a moderate drinking of alcoholic beverages.  Simply
stated, "If wine was good enought for Jesus, it is good enough for me!"</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	We want to closely example the gospel records and Jesus's miracle and statements
about wine.  There are five wine-related stories or saying that one would do well to 
investigate, in this lesson we will only notice the first one.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	1)	The Wedding at Cana -- John 2:1-11</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	2)	New Wine in New Wineskins -- Luke 5:37-38, Mark 2:22</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	3)	Is the "Old Wine" Better? -- Luke 5:39</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	4)	Was Jesus a Glutton and a Drunkard? -- Matt. 11:19, Lk 7:34</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	5)	Jesus's Institution of the Lord's Supper - Matt, Mark, Luke</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>1.	THE WEDDING AT CANA</STRONG></FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">1.	<STRONG>Importance of the Miracle.</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	a.	Those who believe in moderate-drinking view Christ's miraculous
transformation of water into wine at the wedding of Cana as primary
evidence that Jesus sanctioned the use of alcoholic beverages. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	b.	The belief that the wine Christ provided in Cana was alcoholic rests on five
major assumptions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		1)	It is assumed that the word <U>onios</U> "wine" indicates only "fermented-quality grape drink," i.e. wine.\	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		2)	It is even assumed that since the same word "wine" is used for both
that which "ran-out" and what Jesus provided that both were
alcoholic. (We'll see why that say this later.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		3)	It is assumbed that the Jews didn't know how to prevent the
fermentation of grape juice and since this wedding occured six
months after the grape harvest, the wine use at the banquet must
have been fermented.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		4)	It is assumed that the description given by the master of the banquet
to the wine provided by Jesus as "the good wine" must mean it was a
high-quality alcoholic wine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		5)	It is assumed that the expression in John 2:10 "well drunk" used by
the master of the banquet indicated that the guests wee intoxicated
because they had been drinking fermented wine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">2.	In view of these assumptions that the wine Jesus provided was fermented, let's
examine each of them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	1)	The meaning of <U>oinos.</U>  We need to understand that in the Greek, both in the
Bible in the secular usage, the word referred to both fermented and
unfermented grape juice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		a)	The word <U>oinos</U> is used at least 33 times in the LXX to translate
<U>tirosh</U> the Hebrew word for grape juice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		b)	The word "wine" not only in Greek, but in Old English, in Latin, and
in Hebrew is a generic term including all kinds of wine, unfermented
and fermented.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		c)	It corresponds to the Hebrew word <U>yayin</U> in the OT and <U>vinum</U> in
Latin.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		d)	Thus, the fact the wine made by Christ at Cana is called <U>oinos</U> offers
no grounds for concluding hat it was fermented wine.</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	2)	The second assumption is that both the wine that ran out and the wine Jesus
made were both alcoholic.  The same word is used for both.  But this
assumption is discredited by two facts:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		a)	First: The word <U>oinos</U> is generic and its use alone doesn't provide
evidence  that the beverage was either fermented or unfermented.
One must look for more evidence than just the word to determine
what kind of a beverage the subject is.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		b)	Second: There is a distinction made between the two wines in the
text-- that provided by Jesus is call "the good wine."  This suggest
the two were not identical-- the nature of the difference will be
discussed later.</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">3.	<STRONG>The Preservation of Grape Juice</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	a.	The third assumption that six months after the grape harvest they could not
have unfermented grape juice rest on the assumption that the techonology
for presrving grape juice unferment was not known at that time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	b.	The assumption is clearly discredited by numerious testimonies from the
Roman world of NT times describing various methods for preserving grape
juice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	c.	There were several different practices in Palestine in Jesus' day that
preserved unfermented beverages.</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">4.	<STRONG>"High-Quality Alcoholic Wine."</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	a.	The fourth assumption is that wine Jesus produced was pronounced "the
good wine" (John 2:10) by the master of the banquet because it was high in
alcoholic content.  This assumption is based on 20th century ideas of taste,
etc.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	b.	Writers of the Roman world of NT times (Pliny) said that the good wine
was the unfermented which did "not inflame the brain or infest the mind"</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	c.	The common wine drink in Palestine was the simple juice of the grape.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	d.	The wine was "the good wine", i.e, a wine of high quality, but not becasue
of its alcohol content, but becasue as Henry Morris explains it was "new
wine, freshly created."</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">5.	<STRONG>Rabbinical Witnesses.</STRONG>   The rabbinical witness on the nature of wine is not
unanimous.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	a.	Some rabbis even recommend the moderate use of wine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	b.	But equally true, many Talmudic Tarris have in vigorous words condemned
the drinking of alcoholic wine and liquors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	c.	In light of these considerations we would conclude that the wine provided
by Christ was described as "the good wine" because it was fresh and tasty,
and not because it was intoxicating.</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">6.	<STRONG>Moral Implications:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	a.	Let's look at another reason for rejecting the assumption that "the good
wine" produced by Christ was alcoholic.</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	b.	Let's consider if this assumption were true-- that all the wine mentioned in
John 2 was alcoholic -- it alledges that Christ miraculous produced between
120 and 160 gallons of intoxicating wine for men, women and children
gathered at the wedding feast.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		1)	Then Jesus must be held morally responsible for prolonging and
increasing their intoxification.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		2)	His miracle would only serve to sanction the excessive drinking of
alcoholic beverages, not moderate drinking!</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	c.	Joseph P. Free correct observes that the large amount of wine produced by
Christ toward the end of a wedding feast proves either:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		"1.	Excellive [alcoholic] drinking was allowable or</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		"2.	The <U>oinos</U> in this case was grape juice.  In the light of the whole Old
Testament condemnation of [intoxicating] wine, it certainly would
appear that the beverate was grape juice." </FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">7.	<STRONG>Another point about the Moral Implication:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	a.	It is against the principle of Scripture and moral analogy to suppose that
Christ, the Creator of good things (Gen. 1:4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 28 &amp; Col. 1:16)
would exert His supernatural energy to bring into existence an intoxicating
wine which elsewhere in the Scripture He condemns as "a mocker" and "a
brawler" (Prov. 20:1) and which elsewhere in the Scripture it is used as the
symbol of divine wrath..</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	b.	Scriptural and moral consistency require that "the good wine" prodouced by
Christ was fresh unfermented grape juice.  The adjective used was not
<U>agathos,</U> good, simply, but <U>kalos</U>, that which is morally goodly and morally
excellent.</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">8.	"<STRONG>Well Drunk"</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	a.	The final assumption to be exampled relates to the expression "well drunk"
(Jo. 2:10) used by the master of the banquet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		1)	The full statement reads: "Every man at the beginning doth set forth
good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is
worse; but thou hast kept the good wine until now" (Jo. 2:12 KJV).</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	b.	The assumption is that the word <U>methusthosin</U> "well drunk" indicates
drunkenness and since drunkenness is caused, according to the statement of
the banquet master, by the "good wine" cusomarily serve first, then "the
good wine" provided by Christ must also have been intoxicating, because it
is compared with the good wine usually served at the beginning of a feast.</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	c.	Some view this meaning of the Greek word <U>methusko</U> "to intoxicate" as
proof of the alcoholic nature of the wine produced by Christ.</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	d.	However, this reasoning misinterprets and misapplies the comment of the
banquiet master, and overlooks the broader usage of the verb.</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		1)	First-- The comment in question was not made in reference to that
particular party, but to the general practice among those who hold
feast: "Every man serves the good wine first; and when men have
drunk freely, than the poor wine..." (John 2:10, RSV).</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		2)	Even if this verb described intoxicated persons, it is not describing
this particular wedding feast, but such parties in general.</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	e.	But another important consideration is the fact that the Greek verb
<U>methusko</U> also means "to drink freely" without any implication of
intoxication.  Amply lexicon citations demonstrates this.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		1)	The RSV renders it accuratly "when men have drunk freely."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		2)	It simply refers to the large quantity of wine generally consumed at a
feast, without any reference to intoxicating effects.</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">8.	<STRONG>The Object of the Miracle.</STRONG></FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	a.	The stated object of the miracle was for Christ to manifest His gory so that
His disciples might believe in Him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		1)	This objective was accomplished: "This, the first of his signs, Jesus
did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples
believed in him" (John 2:11).</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	b.	Christ's presence at this marriage feast was intended to show divine
approval of the marriage institution and of the innocent enjoyments of
social life.</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	c.	Yet, all of these consideration were subservient to the manifesttation of
Christ's glory in fulfillment of His Messianic mission. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		1)	The fory of God is revealed especially in His act of creation (Ps.
19:1-2).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		2)	Likewise, Christ's "eternal power and deity" (Rom. 1:20) were
manifested at the beginning of His miracles through an act of
creation:  "He ... made the water wine" (John 4:46).</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	d.	The wine of this miracle must have been identical to the wine found in
grape-clusters, because this is the only wine that God produced.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		1)	R.A. Torrey,  writes "There is not a hint that the wine He [Christ]
made was intoxicating.  It was fresh-made wine.  New-made wine is
never intoxicating.  It is not intoxicating until some time after the
process of fermentation has sent it.  Fermentation is the process of
decay.  There is nota hint that our Lord produced alcohol, which is a
product of decay and death.  He produced a living wine
uncontaminated by fermentation."</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		2)	William Pettingill, "I am satisfied that there was little resemblance in
it [winde made by Christ] to the thing described in the Scripture of
God as biting like a serpent and stinging like an adder (Prob. 23:29-32)."</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">9.	<STRONG>Another moral point</STRONG> to consider is that Christ's miracles were always directed to
benevolent ends.  He "came not to destroy men's lives but to save them" (Luke
9:56).  </FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	a.	If it were true that Christ miraculously manufactured an intoxicating wine,
then that miracle would be a notable exception among His miracles.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		1)	It would be malevolent manifestation of His power.  He would have
manifested shame rathern than glory.</FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	b.	Christ was aware of the powerful influence His example would have on
contemporary and future generations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		1)	If, with all this knowledge He created an intoxicating wine, He
would have revealed diabolic rather than divine power and glory.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">		2)	His disciples could hardly have believed in Him, if they had seen
Him do a miracle to encourage durnkenness.</FONT></P>
