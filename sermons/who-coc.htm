<H3>What is the distinctive plea of the church of Christ ?</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>It is primarily a plea for religious unity based upon the Bible. In a divided 
religious world it is believed that the Bible is the only possible common 
denominator upon which most, if not all, of the God-fearing people of the land 
can unite. This is an appeal to go back to the Bible. It is a plea to speak 
where the Bible speak and to remain silent where the Bible is silent in all 
matters that pertain to religion. It further empasizes that in everything 
religious there must be a "Thus saith the Lord" for all that is done. The 
objective is religious unity of all believers in Christ. The basis is the New 
Testament. The method is the restoration of New Testament Christianity.

<CENTER>
<H3>The Historical background of the Restoration Movement</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>One of the earliest advocates of the return to New Testament Christianity, as 
a means of achieving unity of all believers in Christ, was James O'Kelly of the 
Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1793 he withdrew from the Baltimore conference of 
his church and called upon others to join him in taking the Bible as the only 
creed. His influence was largely felt in Virginia and North Carolina where 
history records that some seven thousand communicants followed his leadership 
toward a return to primitive New Testament Christianity. <BR>In 1802 a similar 
movement among the Baptists in New England was led by Abner Jones and Elias 
Smith. They were concerned about "denominational names and creeds" and decided 
to wear only the name Christian, taking Bible as their only guide. In 1804, in 
the western frontier state of Kentucky, Barton W. Stone and several other 
Presbyterian preachers took similar action declaring that they would take the 
Bible as the "only sure guide to heaven." Thomas Campbell, and his illustrious 
son, Alexander Campbell, took similar steps in the year 1809 in what is now the 
state of West Virginia. They contended that nothing should be bound upon 
Christians as a matter of doctrine which is not as old as the New Testament. 
Although these four movements were completely independent in their beginings 
eventually they became one strong restoration movement because of their common 
purpose and plea. These men did not advocate the starting of a new church, but 
rather a return to Christ's church as described in the Bible. <BR>Members of the 
church of Christ do not conceive of themselves as a new church started near the 
begining of the 19th century. Rather, the whole movement is designed to 
reproduce in contemporary times the church originally established on Pentacost, 
A.D. 30. The strength of the appeal lies in the restoration of Christ's original 
church.

<H3>How many churches of Christ are there ?</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>The most recent dependable estimate lists more than 15,000 individual 
churches of Christ. The "Christian Herald," a general religious publication 
which presents statistics concerning all the churches, estimates that the total 
membership of the churches of Christ is now 2,000,000. There are more than 7000 
men who preach publicly. Membership of the church is heaviest in the southern 
states of the United States, particularly Tennessee and Texas, though 
congregations exist in each of the fifty states and in more than eighty foreign 
countries. Missionary expansion has been most extensive since the second World 
War in Europe, Asia and Africa. More than 450 full time workers are supported in 
foreign countries. The churches of Christ now have five times as many members as 
were reported in the U.S. Religious Census of 1936.

<CENTER>
<H3>How are the churches organizationally connected ?</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>Following the plan of organization found in the New Testament, churches of 
Christ are autonomous. Their common faith in the Bible and adherence to its 
teachings are the chief ties which bind them together. There is no central 
headquarters of the church and no organization superior to the elders of each 
local congregation. Congregations do cooperate voluntarily in supporting the 
orphans and the aged, in preaching the gospel in new fields, and in other 
similar works.<BR>Members of the church of Christ conduct forty colleges and 
secondary schools, as well as seventy-five orphanges and homes for the aged. 
There are approximately 40 magazines and other periodicals published by 
individual members of the church. A nationwide radio and television program, 
known as "The Herald of Truth" is sponsored by the Highland Avenue church in 
Abilene, Texas. Much of its annual budget of $1,200,000 is contributed on a 
free-will basis by other churches of Christ. The radio program is currently 
heard on more than 800 radio stations, while the television program is now 
appearing on more than 150 stations. Another extensive radio effort known as 
"World Radio" owns a network of 28 stations in Brazil alone, and is operating 
effectively in the United States and a number of other foreign countries, and is 
being produced in 14 languages. An extensive advertising program in leading 
national magazines began in November 1955.<BR>There are no conventions, annual 
meetings, or official publications. The "tie that binds" is a common loyalty to 
the principles of the restoration of New Testament Christianity.

<CENTER>
<H3>How are the churches of Christ governed ?</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>In each congregation, which has existed long enough to become fully 
organized, there is a plurality of elders or presbyters who serve as the 
governing body. These men are selected by the local congregations on the basis 
of qualifications set down in the scriptures (1 Timothy 3:1-8). Serving under 
the elders are deacons, teachers, and evangelists or ministers. The latter do 
not have the authority equal to or superior to the elders. The elders are 
shepherds or overseers who serve under the headship of Christ according to the 
New Testament, which is a kind of constitution. There is no earthly authority 
superior to the elders of the local church.

<CENTER>
<H3>What does the church of Christ believe about the Bible ?</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>The original autographs of the sixty six books which make up the Bible are 
considered to have been divinely inspired, by which it is meant that they are 
infallible and authoritative. Reference to the scriptures is made in settling 
every religious question. A pronouncement from the scripture is considered the 
final word. The basic textbook of the church and the basis for all preaching is 
the Bible. 
<P><A href="#top">Back to the top of the

<P><A name=virgin>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H3>Do members of the churches of Christ believe in the virgin birth 
?</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>Yes. The statement in Isaiah 7:14 is taken as a prophecy of the virgin birth 
of Christ. New Testament passages such as Matthew 1:20, 25, are accepted at face 
value as declarations of the virgin birth. Christ is accepted as the only 
begotten Son of God, uniting in his person perfect divinity and perfect manhood.

<P><A name=predestination>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H3>Does the church of Christ believe in predestination ?</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>Only in the sense tht God predestines the righteous to be eternally saved and 
the unrighteous to be eternally lost. The statement of the apostle Peter, "Of a 
truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons, but in every nation he 
that feareth him and worketh righteousness is acceptable unto him"(Acts 
10:34-35.) is taken as an evidence that God did not predestine individuals to be 
eternally saved or lost, but that each man determines his own destiny. 
<P><A href="#top">Back to the top of the

<P><A name=baptism>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H3>Why does the church of Christ baptize only by immersion ?</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>The word baptize comes from the Greek word "baptizo" and literally means, "to 
dip, to immerse, to plunge." In addition to the literal meaning of the word, 
immersion is practiced because it was the practice of the church in apostolic 
times. Still further, only immersion conforms to the description of baptisms as 
given by the apostle Paul in Romans 6:3-5 where he speaks of it as a burial and 
resurrection.

<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H3>Is infant baptism practiced ?</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>No. Only those who have reached the "age of accountability" are accepted for 
baptisms. It is pointed out that the examples given in the New Testament are 
always of those who have heard the gospel preached and have believed it. Faith 
must always precede baptism, so only those old enough to understand and believe 
the gospel are considered fit subjects for baptism. 
<P><A href="#top">Back to the top of the

<P><A name=confession>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H3>Do ministers of the church hear confession ?</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>No. Ministers or evangelists of the church have no special perogatives. They 
do not wear the title of Reverand or Father, but are addressed simply by the 
term Brother as are all other men of the church. Along with elders and others 
they do counsel and advise those seeking help. 
<P><A href="#top">Back to the top of the

<P><A name=prayer>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H3>Are prayers addressed to the saints ?</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>No. God the Father is considered the only one to whom the prayers may be 
addressed. It is further understood that Christ stands in a mediatorial position 
between God and man (Hebrews 7:25). All prayers are therefore offered through 
Christ, or in the name of Christ (John 16:23-26). 
<P><A href="#top">Back to the top of the

<P><A name=supper>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H3>How often is the Lord's supper eaten ?</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>It is expected that every member of the church will assemble for worship on 
each Lord's day. A central part of the worship is the eating of the Lord's 
supper (Acts 20:7). Unless providentially hindered, each member considers this 
weekly appointment as binding. In many instances, as in the case of illness, the 
Lord's supper is carried to those who are hindered from attending the worship.

<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H3>What kind of music is used in the worship ? </H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>As a result of the distinctive plea of the church - a return to New Testament 
Faith and practice - acapella singing is the only music used in the worship. 
This singing, unaccompanied by mechanical instruments of music, conforms to the 
music used in the apostolic church and for several centuries thereafter 
(Ephesians 5:19). It is felt that there is no authority for engaging in acts of 
worship not found in the New Testament. This principle eliminates the use of 
instrumental music, along with the use of candles, incense, and other similar 
elements.

<CENTER>
<H3>Does the church of Christ believe in heaven and hell ? </H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>Yes. The statement of Christ in Matthew 25, and elsewhere, are taken at face 
value. It is believed that after death each man must come before God in 
judgement and that he will be judged according to the deeds done while he lived 
(Hebrews 9:27). After judgement is pronounced he will spend eternity either in 
heaven or hell.

<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H3>Does the church of Christ believe in purgatory ? </H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>No. The absence of any reference in the scriptures to the temporary place of 
punishment from which the soul will eventually be released into heaven prevents 
the acceptance of the doctrine of purgatory.

<H3>By what means does the church secure financial support ?</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>Each first day of the week the members of the church "lay by in store as they 
have been prospered" (1 Corinthians 16:2). The amount of any individual gift is 
generally known only to the one who gave it and to the Lord. This free-will 
offering is the only call which the church makes. NO assessments or other levies 
are made. No money-making activities, such as bazaars or suppers, are engaged 
in. A total if approximately $200,000,000 is given on this basis each year.

<CENTER>
<H3>Does the church of Christ have a creed ? </H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>No. At least, there is no creed in the usual sense of the word. The belief of 
the church is stated fully and completely in the Bible. There is no other manual 
or discipline to which the members of the church of Christ give their 
allegiance. The Bible is considered as the only infallible guide to heaven.

<H3>How does one become a member of the church of Christ ? </H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG alt="" 
src="rainban.gif"></CENTER>
<P>In the salvation of man's soul there are 2 necessary parts: God's part and 
man's part. God's part is the big part, "For by grace you have been saved 
through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift if God; not of works, 
that no man should glory" (Ephesians 2:8-9). The love which God felt for man led 
him to send Christ into the world to redeem man. The life and teaching of Jesus, 
the sacrifice on the cross, and the proclaiming of the gospel to men constitute 
God's part in salvation.
<P>Though God's part is the big part, man's part is also necessary if man is to 
reach heaven. Man must comply with the conditions of pardon which the Lord has 
announced. Man's part can clearly set forth in the following steps: 
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Hear the Gospel.</STRONG> "How shall they call on him whom they have 
not believed? and how shall they believe him whom they have not heard? and how 
shall they hear without a preacher?"(Romans 10:14).
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG>Believe.</STRONG> "And without faith it is impossible to be 
wellpleasing unto him; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and 
that he is a rewarder of them that seek after him" (Hebrews 11:6).
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG>Repent of past sins.</STRONG> "The times of ignorance therefore God 
overlooked; but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere 
repent."(Acts 17:30).
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG>Confess Jesus as Lord.</STRONG> "Behold here is water; What doth 
hinder me to be baptized ? And Philip said, if thou believeth with all thy heart 
thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of 
God" (Acts 8:36-37).
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG>Be baptized for the remission of sins.</STRONG> "And Peter said unto 
them, Repent ye, and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ 
unto the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy 
Spirit."(Acts 2:38).
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG>Live a Christian life.</STRONG> "Ye are an elect race, a royal 
priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, that ye may show 
forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous 
light" (1 Peter 2:9).

<P><STRONG>Now that you are aware of a church in the 20th century which is built 
according to the blue prints of Christ's original church, why not become a 
member of it ? In becoming a member of it, you will be called upon to do nothing 
which you cannot read in the New Testament. You will then live and worship just 
as the apostle-guided Christians of the first century did.
<P>Not only is this return to New Testament Christianity a wonderful basis upon 
which all believers in Christ can unite, it is absolutely solid ground. If we do 
just what our Lord commanded we know that our salvation is certain. Come with us 
as we go back to the Bible, back to Christ and his church. !
