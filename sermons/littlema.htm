</B></FONT><P>&#9;<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Luke 19:1-10</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P>Many Bible characters are relatively unknown, but even children know about one little fellow, though he appears in only one brief scene in the New Testament, Zaccheus. Most children</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>s Bible classes sing a song about him.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, many of us stopped studying about Zaccheus when we reached eight or nine. The story of Zaccheus contains beautiful and powerful lessons. For instance, many would immediately recognize this verse: </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>For the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (Luke 19:10). Have you ever thought about what event prompted that great passage? It is in the story of Zaccheus.</P>
<P>For a few moments, let us look at Luke 19 and study the story of this </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>wee little man</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> who was </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>a wee little sinner.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> As we do so, I want to pull from this text some </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>wee little lessons.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</P>
</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800000"><P>A LESSON ON WEALTH </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> Luke 10:1-2</P>
</B><P>The chapter begins, </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>And he entered and was passing through Jericho</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 1). Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. For months He had been traveling </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>with his face toward Jerusalem,</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> and now He was getting into the region of Jerusalem, into Judea, with Jerusalem less than 20 miles away.</P>
<P>Jericho is one of the most ancient of cities. If you were to visit that city today you would be shown vast mounds where ancient city after city had been built on top of each other. In Jesus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> time it was a beautiful city, known for her palm trees and rose gardens. Some of the streets were lined with what the Bible calls sycamore trees. These were mulberry-fig trees, trees with leaves like mulberry trees. They grew thirty to forty feet, had short trunks and spreading branches close to the ground. They provided a welcome shade in such a land as Palestine.</P>
<P>Jericho had many riches. One source of riches were its date palms, whose fruit was sold around the world; it was famous for its balsam groves that provided a fragrant and soothing ointment sold around the world.</P>
<P>Another reason Jericho was wealthy was her location. It was at the heart and center of a vast trade route network. Situated in the Jordan valley in control the routes east and west and north and south to such cities as Damascus, Tyre, Jerusalem and Ammon, and to Mesopotamia, Arabian, and Persian cities. And it is important to remember that all goods passing through Jericho were subject to taxation.</P>
<P>As Jesus began to pass through the city the events of the story began to unfold. </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>And behold, there was a man called by the name of Zaccheus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 2a). </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>Zacchaeus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> is a Hebrew name meaning </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>pure</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> or </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>righteous.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> His name reflects the hope his mother had for her baby boy. However, Zaccheus was not looked upon as either pure or righteous by the citizens of Jericho. The reason is given in the next part of the text... </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>... and he was a chief tax-gatherer</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 2a). </P>
<P>Tax collectors were no more popular then than they are now. I</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>ve never know a parent to say, </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>My dream for my child is that he will grow up to be a tax collector.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> However, being a tax-collector today is an honored professions compared to what it was in the time of Christ.</P>
<P>In Palestine, tax collectors were Jews who worked for the Roman government collecting taxes from their own people to support the nation that had overrun their country and occupied their land for about a century now. To become a tax-collector, one had to get a concession from the Roman government (often a hefty bribe was involved). The Romans than told him how much he was expected to collect each year; sometimes this had to be paid in advance. He made his profit by charging enough to keep back to himself a very profitable percentage. It was a system ripe for greed, dishonesty, and corruption.</P>
<P>As a result, other Jews consider tax-collectors as traitors and turncoats, no longer true sons of Abraham. According to the Jewish code, a tax-collector could not vote; he couldn</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>t testify in court; and he was not allowed to go into the synagogue.</P>
<P>In the scriptures, tax collectors are invariably lumped with undesirables: </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>tax-collectors and sinners</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (Matt. 18:17); </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>tax-collectors and harlots</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (Matt. 21:31,32) </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or... this tax-collector</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (Luke 18:11).</P>
<P>Zaccheus was not merely a tax-collector, he was </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>a <B>chief</B> tax-collector.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> Barclay translates this phrase </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>commissioner of taxes.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> Apparently Zacchaeus had purchased the tax-concession for that entire area, and he had tax-collectors working under him. He would have received a percentage for each of these tax-collectors working in the region. To the Jews in that region, Zaccheus was the head of the local Mafia, the Jewish Godfather.</P>
<P>Considering the widespread nature of Zaccheus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> enterprise, we are not surprised to read the next words: </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><B><I><FONT SIZE=4>and he was rich.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</B></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 2c). Zaccheus had prospered from lucrative position in Jericho.</P>
<P>Had Zaccheus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>s wealth made him a happy satisfied man? I don</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>t think I</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>m reading too much into the text to say that although Zaccheus had money, he did not have happiness. He was probably the most hated man in Jericho. When Jesus went home with him, the text says, </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>They <B>all </B>began to grumble, saying, </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>&gt;</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 7). How would like to be the most despised man in town</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> a total outcast? Imagine what this would do to your wife, to your children?</P>
<P>I</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>m sure that Zaccheus wasn</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>t a happy with being the most despised man in town. I believe that, either consciously or unconsciously, Zaccheus was seeking Jesus because he <B>wanted</B> Jesus to help him turn his life around. Perhaps he had heard that Jesus was the friend of tax-collectors and sinners (Matthew 11:19). Perhaps, he had herd that Jesus had called Matthew, a tax-collector, to be one of His disciples (Luke 5:27). Perhaps Matthew had even been a friend of Zaccheus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>.</P>
<P>Hear this little lesson on wealth: Money and things cannot buy happiness. Possessions are quickly gone, and things do not comfort. To be happy, we need relationships with others. Especially do we need a right relationship with our God.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800000"><P>A LESSON ON SEEKING THE LORD </FONT><FONT SIZE=4>-- (Luke 19:3, 4)</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4><P>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>And he was trying to see who Jesus was</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 3a). Literally, the text read, </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>And he was <I>seeking</I> to see Jesus.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> Wherever a form of the word </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>seek</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> is found in the New Testament it always indicates a diligent effort, it never denotes a half-hearted attempt. Zacchaeus had heard that Jesus was passing through Jericho and he was <B>determined</B> to see Him.</P>
<P>However, when he tried, </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>he was unable because of the crowd</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 3b). Many of the pilgrims going up to Jerusalem for the feast had gathered around Jesus and were traveling with Him. In addition, word had gone ahead and people no doubt, lined the streets of Jericho, probably several deep as Jesus and the travelers passed along.</P>
<P>Zacchaeus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> problem is stated in the last part of the verse: </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>He was unable... for he was small in stature</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 3c). To say it plainly, he was a short man. We can imagine him trying to push through the crowd to get where he could see. When people saw who it was, it was their chance to get back at the hated tax collector. Can</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>t you imagine him standing at the back, hopping and down, straining to see over the crowd, with no success. </P>
<P>As Jesus and the crowd began to move, and Zaccheus was not one to give up easily. He was determined to see Jesus. Probably seeing the street lined with the trees, he got an idea. He may have even seen others, perhaps boys, up in the trees looking to see Jesus. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4><P>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>And he ran on ahead</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 4a). Wealthy important men of Zaccheus station walked with dignity, but here we see something about Zacchaeus. He ran. We picture him pulling up his robes and stretching out his short legs, skirting the crowd and running ahead down the street.</P>
<P>Zaccheus </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>climbed up into a sycamore tree in order to see Him, for He was about to pass through that way</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 4b). We see his enthusiasm and wonder how long it had been since Zacchaeus had climbed a tree. Zacchaeus would let nothing stand in his way of seeing Jesus, not the crowd, not his height, not his pride.</P>
<P>Moses put our little lesson on seeking the Lord this way: </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>But . . . you will seek the Lord your God, and you will find Him if you search for Him with all your heart and all your soul.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (Deut. 4:29). [Years ago a student and a teacher walked together along a street. The student asked the teacher how he could find the Lord. The teacher grabbed the young man, pulled him over to a watering trough, thrust his head under the water, and held him there. When he released him, the young man stood, water running down his face, gasping for air. The teacher said, </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>When you want to find the Lord as keenly as you wished for air, you will find Him!</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> ]</P>
<P>Zacchaeus was ready to do what it took to find the Lord! We need to be that determined to find truth (John 8:32)!</P>
</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800000"><P>A LESSON ON COMPASSION</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> -- (Luke 19:5-7).</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4><P>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 5a). The KJV says, </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>he looked up, and saw him.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> Zacchaeus probably thought no one would see him hidden among the broad leaves of the tree, but Jesus saw him. Remember the verse with which this closes (v. 10) Zacchaeus was not the only one seeking; Jesus was also seeking. Jesus was seeking the lost.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4><P>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>And said to him, Zacchaeus, hurry and come down</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 5b). How astonished Zacchaeus must have been when Jesus called out his name! But Jesus not only knew his name, he knew everything else about him, his needs, the ache in his heart ... even his potential!</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4><P>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>Zacchaeus, hurry . . . for today I must stay at your house</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 5c). Isn</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>t it amazing? Jesus invited himself to Zacchaeus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> home for dinner! What would you think if someone you had never met before, walked up to you and said, </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>I</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>m going home with you. What are you having for supper?</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P>However, if Jesus was to go into Zacchaeus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> house, He would have to invite Himself</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> for Rabbis would not go into the houses of tax-collectors, nor would Pharisees, or Sadducees, or scribes.</P>
<P>Notice the word </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>must,</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>Today I <B>must</B> stay at your house.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> Jesus came </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>to seek and save the lost</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> and here was one of the lost. In effect Jesus said, </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>I <B>must</B> stay at your house, if <B>salvation</B> is to come to your house!</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P>What was Zacchaeus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> response? </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>And he hurried and came down</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 6a). See him scrambling down out of the tree, he still was not worried about appearing dignified. </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>And received Him gladly</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 6b). It may have been a long time since Zacchaeus had anything to smile about or to be happy, but can</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>t you image the joy that lights up his face now! Jesus was coming to his home!</P>
<P>Most of us are familiar with Walt Disney</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>s Scrooge McDuck, </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>the richest duck in the world.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> Scrooge McDuck is happy only when diving and swimming in his pool of money. He</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>s just a cartoon character, but he represents multiplied thousands who think that the way to find happiness in is money. However, Zacchaeus, had already discovered that happiness did not come through amassing fortunes. Instead, it came when Jesus showed concern and compassion for him.</P>
<P>As Jesus and Zacchaeus walked away, verse 7 tells of the reaction of the crowd: </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>And when they saw it, they all began to grumble, saying, </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>&gt;</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>He has gone to be the guest of man who is a sinner.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=@</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P>Earlier, when He was criticized for eating with tax-collectors and sinner, He had said, </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (Matthew 9:12). However, it was a hard lesson for His hearer to learn.</P>
<P>You and I need to learn this little lesson on compassion: Jesus loves everyone. Regardless of what has happened in a person</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>s life, how deep in sin that individual may be, or how bad his reputation, Jesus loves him</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> and so should we!</P>
</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800000"><P>A LESSON ON REPENTANCE</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (Luke 19:8)</P>
</B><P>Luke doesn</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>t give us any details of Jesus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> say in Zacchaeus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> home. We</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>d like to know how long he stayed, what all they talked about, and how Jesus touched this little man</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>s heart. Luke gives just the results in verse 8: </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>And Zacchaeus stopped</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 8a) What ever Zaccheus was doing, he suddenly stopped to make an announcement.</P>
<P>Zacchaeus spoke to Jesus: </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>Behold, Lord, half of my possession I will give to the poor ...</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (V. 8b). Literally, </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=4>I am giving</I> to the poor.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> This is something he was going to do NOW!</P>
<P>Zacchaeus continued with his announcement: </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>And if I have defrauded anyone of anything</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 8c). The Greek mood of this statement assumes it to be true. </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>I will give back four times as much</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 8d). The law said that if a thief confessed, he had to repay what he had stolen plus one-fifth. If he stole $100, he was to pay back $120. In certain extreme cases, restoring twofold or four fold was required (Num. 5:7; Lev. 6:5; Ex. 22:1, 4, 7 ) but these did not fit Zacchaeus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> situation. Zacchaeus was not <B>required</B> to repay four-fold, but he was not interest in just getting by with some bare minimum. He said, in effect, </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>If I have taken $100 from a man, I will give $400 back.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P>Zacchaeus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> attitude is a beautiful demonstration of biblical repentance. The word </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>repentance</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> is translated from a Greek word that means </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>change of mind or attitude.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> A key aspect of repentance is <I>the willingness to make restitution for the past,</I> as far as possible. Some time restitution is no possible. For instance, Peter told the people who had crucified Jesus to repent (Acts 2:23, 38) but there was no way that could unto their terrible deed. In most cases, however, some kind of restitution is possible. John the Baptizer told his hearers </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>... bring forth <B>fruits</B> in keeping with repentance</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (Luke 3:8). [Matt. 21:29] Unfortunately, the importance of restitution is often overlooked in the matter of repentance.</P>
<P>The hardest part of conversion is not baptism, but repentance. Repentance involves being brokenhearted. Repentance means that one is moved enough to bring about real changes in his life! If your conversion has not made a difference in your life, you may want to consider whether you have really been converted!</P>
<P>Zacchaeus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> conversion made a difference in his life! We need to learn this little lesson on repentance.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800000"><P>A LESSON ON SALVATION</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (Luke 19:9, 10)</P>
</B><P>Jesus responded to Zacchaeus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>s words: </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>Today salvation has come to this house</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 9a). Salvation had come to Zacchaeus because he had responded properly to the love and concern of Jesus. Not only had Jesus come into Zacchaeus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> house, but He had come into his heart.</P>
<P>Next, we have these stirring word: </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> (v. 10). Not only was Zacchaeus seeking Jesus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> but Jesus was seeking Zacchaeus. It seems always that when men are honestly and sincerely seeking the Lord, the Lord goes out seeking them. Remember the Ethiopian, sincerely seeking and reading his Bible</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> and God sent Philip to him. Cornelius worshiping and praying</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> and the Lord sent Peter. A women worshiping and praying by a river bank in Macedonia</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> and the Lord sent Paul.</P>
<P>Today as people sincerely seek</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> don</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>t you think they will find! The gospel can be heard around the world today on shortwave</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> every hour of the day! The gospel can be accessed by correspondence courses </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> wherever there is mail! The gospel is found on the Internet</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> everywhere there is a phone and a computer! The Lord is </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>seeking</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> the lost.</P>
<P>But this verse says something about the </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>lost.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> as well. Most of us have heard the word </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>lost</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> so often in sermon that it doesn</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>t register what all that means. That which is lost is that which is out of place, and therefore, useless and worthless. Remember Jesus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> parables bout the lost sheep, the lost coin. The wonderful part of this verse is that Jesus says he has come seeking and save the lost. He was even now, on his way to Jerusalem </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> there to die on the cross for the sins of the world.</P>
<B><P>CONCLUSION:</P>
</B><P>What an exciting day it was for Zacchaeus as this </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>wee little sinner</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> became a </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>great big follower</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> of Jesus! It is not hard for us to put ourselves in Zacchaeus</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> place. Whatever tree you</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>re hiding in</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> Jesus can see you! He is saying to you, </FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>I want to go home with you.</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>@</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> And like Zacchaeus, you can let him come into your house and into your life</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> will you be as big a man a Zacchaeus this morning!</P>
<P>When Zacchaeus awoke that morning in Jericho, he could not have known how exciting the day would turn out. That Jesus of Nazareth would come to HIS home! I don</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>=</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>t know how this day started for you. Perhaps you woke up still tired and sleepy. Maybe you struggled over whether to be here or not. Maybe the day has not improved much. However, if you can see Jesus standing at the door of your heart, asking to come it, what an exciting day this can be for you! If you will let Jesus in</FONT><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE=4>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=4> today salvation has come to your house!</P>
