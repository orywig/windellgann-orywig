</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#ff0000"><P ALIGN="CENTER">Daniel 1</P>
</B></I></FONT><P>Approximately six hundred years 13. C. Jerusalem and Judea were in definite decline. The powerful Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem, claimed its spoil, and took certain of its people captive. The story is told in the opening chapter of the book of Daniel, as follows, <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>In the third year of the reign of Jehoikim king of Judah, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged it. And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them unto the land of Shinar to the house of his god: and he brought the vessels into the treasure house his god.</P>
<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols"><P>A</FONT>And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in certain of the children of Israel, even of the seed royal and of the nobles; youths in whom was no blemish, but well<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">C</FONT>favored and skillful in all wisdom, and endued with knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability to stand in the king’s palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king’s dainties and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end thereof they should stand before the king. Now among .L these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. And the prince of the eunuchs gave names unto them: unto Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.</P>
<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols"><P>A</FONT>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s dainties, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of tie prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. Now God made Daniel to find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs.<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT> Although uncertain that he should allow this privilege, the prince of the eunuchs did allow a ten day testing period in which he gave the Hebrew young men <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>pulse to eat, and water to drink.<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT> <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>And at the end of ten days their countenance appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths that did eat of the king’s dainties. So the steward took away their dainties, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse. Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. . . Among them all was found none like Daniel. . . And in every matter of wisdom and understanding concerning which the king inquired of them, he <I>found </I>them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his realm.’ (Dan. 1:1<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">C</FONT>9, 12, 15<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">C</FONT>17, 20.)</P>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=4><P>A </I>Difficult Decision</P>
</B></FONT><P>These four Hebrew young men faced a very difficult situation. Their own nation crumbled to pieces and was completely destroyed before their own eyes. Th&amp;. suddenly, they were given tremendous opportunity to rise in their new nation. The would be trained, given special privileges, and then placed as rulers in key positions among their own people, possibly in their own land. But there was one problem, the change would also involve their religion. They would need to eat things that were not legal for Jews to eat. They would need to do things that would not be acceptable to God. Therefore, these four young men made a very courageous decision. They went God’s way rather than the appealing, lucrative, flattering way of the Babylonians. Their decision was one of the greatest and most thrilling recorded in the entire Bible. Their decision led them upward to greatness.</P>
<P>I have felt that this example is an ideal introduction to the theme which I want to discuss with you at this hour, <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>The Making of Great Decisions.<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT> Throughout each of our lives we constantly face the responsibility of making decisions. In fact, making decisions is both the most difficult and most important activity of our lives. The success which we achieve both here and hereafter depends largely upon the decisions that we make. This responsibility is both frightening and thrilling. It is frightening when we think of the magnitude of the effects of our decisions. It is thrilling to realize that we hare the privilege of making these decisions. When God created man he made him different from every animal on earth. Only man was made in the image of God and this included the privilege of being a creature of choice. Man alone has the ability to make decisions and to determine his course in life and his ultimate destiny.</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800000"><P>Old Testament Examples</P>
</B></FONT><P>Throughout the Bible we are introduced to hundreds and hundreds of characters. All are interesting, because they are real<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">C</FONT>life people in normal situations such as we face today. They are particularly interesting because we have the privilege of seeing them at the climactic moments in their lives when they make major decisions. For example, we are introduced to Abram just at the time when God extends to him this invitation, "Now Jehovah said unto Abram: Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto the land that I will show thee: and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing: and I will bless them that bless thee, And him that curseth thee will I curse; and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT> (Gen 12:1<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">C</FONT>3.) Abram was living in Ur of Chaldees at the time and this was the most advanced civilization of the day. God called upon him to leave Ur, with its known and familiar way of life and with its family and friends, in order to move into a strange new land which he had never seen. Abram had the vision to see that the wise decision was to follow God’s directions wherever they might lead. His decision led him to move upward to greatness.</P>
<P>Similarly, we have the privilege of observing Moses as he makes his crucial decision between a life of luxury in the royal family of Egypt and a life of privation and toil among the Hebrews. In the New Testament book of Hebrews, we read of his decision, <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>By faith Moses when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter; choosing rather to share ill treatment with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; accounting the proach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he looked unto the recompense of reward.<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT> (Heb. 11:24<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">C</FONT>27.)</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800000"><P>New Testament Examples</P>
</B></FONT><P>As we move into the New Testament there are many additional examples of great decisions. One is deeply impressed by the greatness manifested in the lives of the men whom Christ called to be apostles. The opening paragraph of the fifth chapter of Luke tells the thrilling story of Christ working a miracle among a band of Galilean fishermen. After he had miraculously provided a great catch of fish, Peter fell down at Jesus’ knees and said, <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT> Jesus responded, <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>Feat not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT> The story ends with the words, <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>And when they had brought their boats to land, they left all, and followed him.<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT> (Luke 5:8, 10<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">C</FONT>11.) In this instance Peter, Andrew, James and John were willing to leave home, occupation, and way of life to follow Jesus into the unknown future. In doing so they moved upward to greatness.</P>
<P>At the same opening in my Bible I also read, <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>And after these things he went forth, and beheld a publican named Levi, sitting at the place of toll, and said unto him, Follow me. And he forsook all, and rose up and followed him." (Luke 5:27<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">C</FONT>28.) How easy it would have been for Matthew Levi to tell the Lord that he was busy with an important occupation and that he could not immediately do anything about Christ’s invitation, but that he would gladly consider it at some future time. The fact that he did nothing of this kind, but immediately, began his walk with the Lord is impressive indeed. We are also impressed with the conversion and call of Saul of Tarsus. We read the story in Acts 9, 22, and 26, and are moved by the manner in which this great persecutor of Christians changed the direction of his life and becomes a foremost disciple of the Lord.</P>
<P>Similarly, we are impressed with the story of Aquilla and Priscilla, as We read it in Acts 18:1<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">C</FONT>3. They had been cast out of Rome by the Emperor Claudius who disliked the Jews. They met Paul at Corinth where they worked together as tentmakers. Afterward , they traveled to Ephesus with Paul. We are not told the details of their conversion, but it is easy to read between the lines and to feel the influence of Paul upon them and the eagerness with which they accepted this new and more wonderful way of life. Their decision was the gateway not only to heaven eventually but also to a life of happiness and service here on earth.</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#800000"><P>Suggestions For Making Decisions</P>
</B></FONT><P>As we move from infancy to childhood, to young manhood or young womanhood, to the middle years of life and finally to old age, we are constantly making decisions. We must decide where to live, with its implications of significance, because in choosing our place to live we also choose our associates and companions. Their lives flow into our lives; their influence is felt upon our thinking and our behavior. Where we live is a major decision. We also must decide how to live and this is even of greater significance. What set of values shall we accept? What pattern of behavior shall we follow? How shall we spend our time, our talents, and our resources? Countless decisions of major significance are involved. Then there is the matter of whom we shall marry. This is a decision of tremendous proportions. There is the matter of which occupation we shall choose as our means of livelihood. Beyond these there are many other decisions. Every day brings its quota. Just how are we to make these decisions? What guidelines are there? Let us suggest a few.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#800000"><P>Suggestion 1:</FONT> </B><U>Every decision must be made in a way that God will approve. </U>This is a broad fundamental bed rock principle that will guide us in everything that we do. It is the crucially important first principle in making all our decisions. It implies a need to know God’s word thoroughly and to be fully acquainted with what God approves in order that we may apply it in the making of our decisions. The motive behind the acceptance of this basic principle is two<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">C</FONT>fold:</P>
<P>First, we choose to make our decisions in a way that will please God because of our love for God. He has loved us and blessed us so extensively that we want to love him in return. In the second place, we do it out of love for ourselves. We have discovered that when we go <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>against the grain’ of God’s will we destroy ourselves. His teachings, his principles, his guidance are for man’s good and when man tries different approach to life he only tears himself to pieces. For our own good, We must follow the instructions that God has given us in the Bible as to how men ought to live, In this way we find greater happiness and success.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#800000"><P>Suggestion 2:</B></FONT> <U>Our decisions must not be made in haste, but only after We have examined all the facts.</U> In Luke 15 we read the story of the prodigal son. Rashly and without full consideration he asked for his inheritance, immediately he went into a far country and wasted his substance in riotous living. If he had taken more time to make his initial decision, had talked with wise counselors, and had faced all the facts, he would not have found himself in the pig pen In the foreign land.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#800000"><P>Suggestion 3: </B></FONT><U>Our decisions must not be made with the emotions alone1, but with the mind.</U> In the Old Testament we read the tragic story of David’s sin with Bathsheba. His emotions carried him away and before the story was ended he had committed adultery, had lied, and had even murdered Uriah. How different it would have been if David had made his decision concerning Bathsheba with his head instead d of his emotions. The tragic blot on his record would not be there for all men of all succeeding centuries to read.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#800000"><P>Suggestion 4:</B> </FONT><U>Our decisions must not follow the path of least resistance, but must be courageously made.</U> In Acts 24 we read the story of Paul preaching before Felix the Roman Governor of Palestine. The text says that he <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>reasoned of righteousness and self<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">C</FONT>control, and the judgment to come.<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT> It further says that <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me.<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT> (Acts 24:25.) What a tragic decision Felix made. In weak vacillation he made the decision that cost him his soul.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#800000"><P>Suggestion 5</FONT>:</B> <U>Our decisions must choose the best, not for the moment but for the long run. </U>In Luke 18:23, we read the story of the rich young ruler who came to Christ. He asked what he must do to be saved. Christ told him to keep the commandments and then told him to sell all that he had and give it to the poor, The story ends as the young man departed sorrowfully, for he was one who had great possessions. We are in a better position than he to see the tragedy of his decision. We can see the relative unimportance of a little Palestinian real estate and a few baubles of earthly possessions. How differently he would make his decision if he could make it again.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#800000"><P>Suggestion 6</FONT>:</B> <U>Our decisions must not merely follow the crowd, but must be based upon the right or wrong of the situation.</U> In Mark 15:8<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">C</FONT>15, we are told that Pilate upon the facts of the case found no fault in Jesus. He considered him both unworthy of death and of imprisonment and tried to release him as his "prisoner of the year.<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT> The multitude insisted on Barabbas, so ultimately Pilate washed his hands of the whole matter in weak subservience to the pressures of the crowd. Right led one way, social pressure led the other. Pilate went down to eternal condemnation under the pressures of the people.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#800000"><P>Suggestion 7:</B></FONT> <U>Our decisions must not be made by default, but with full consciousness</U>. In the Old Testament time of Joshua the people had entered the promised land and were thoughtlessly drifting in the direction of idolatry. As the final recorded act of the great patriarch Joshua he called the people to face squarely the drift of their own behavior as he presented to them the challenge, <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>Now therefore fear Jehovah, and serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the river, and in Egypt; and serve ye Jehovah. And if it seem evil unto you to serve Jehovah, choose you this day whom you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served which were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but for me and my douse, we will serve Jehovah.<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT> A few moments later the crowd echoed back its decision, <FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</FONT>We also will serve Jehovah; for he is our God.<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</FONT> (Josh. 24:14 - 15, 18.) Many people do not make their decisions at all, but through indecisiveness and vacillation discover that they have already passed the point where the decisions could be made. Through default they have actually made the decisions already.</P>
<P>Each of us must decide his own destiny. God deals with us as individuals, not as nations or families. No one else can make our decisions for us. This is particularly true in our decisions concerning God and Christianity. What is your decision concerning Christ now? Where do you want to spend your influence while here on earth? Where do you want to spend eternity? These simple questions lead to the moment of decision. If you are not a Christian, will you make the decision to come to Christ now?</P>
