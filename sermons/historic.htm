 1. Yohanan ben-Zakkai<BR>


   First president of the reconstituted Sanhedrin after the destruction of the Temple and the fall of

Jerusalem in AD 70.  With head-quarters at Jabneh or Jamnia, in the south-west of Palestine, this group began to codify the "the tradition of the elders" mentioned in the New Testament which had been previously only handed down orally from generation to generation, increasing with the years.<P>




 2. Rabbi Akiba<BR>


   Began arranging the codified traditions according to subject-matter.  After his heroic death in AD

135 on the defeat of Bar-Kokhba's rebellion against Rome, his work was revised and continued by

his pupil Rabbi Mier.<P>




 3. Rabbi Meir<BR>


   Pupil to Rabbi Akiba who carried on the work of Rabbi Akiba upon his death.<P>




 4. Codification of oral traditions completed by Rabbi Judah<BR>


    President of the Sanhedrin from 170 - 217 AD.  The completed code of religious jurisprudence is

known as the Mishnah. 


   The commentaries on the Mishnah are called the Gemaras and together they are usually

known as the Talmud.<BR>




  The Jerusalem Talmud   c. 300 AD  <BR>


    (Not made in Jerusalem, but in the Palestinian schools in the south and in Galilee was completed

about AD 300).<BR><P>




  

  The Babylonian Talmud c. 500 AD  <BR>


   The much larger Babylonian Talmud continued to grow for two more centuries before it was

reduced to writing about AD 500.<P>

This story as told by Josephus:<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

 "When Agrippa had reigned three full years over all Judea, he came to the city of Caesarea, which

was formerly called Strato's Tower.  There he exhibited shows in honor of Caesar, inaugurating

this as a festival for the emperor's welfare. [Possibly on Claudius' birthday, which fell on August

1st.] And there came together to it a multitude of the provincial officials and of those who had been

promoted to a distinguished position.  On the second day of the shows he put on a robe all made of

silver, of altogether wonderful weaving, and arrived in the theater at break of day.  Then the silver

shone as the sun's first rays fell upon it and glittered wonderfully, its resplendence inspiring a sort

of fear and trembling in those who gazed upon it.  Immediately his flatterers called out from

various quarters, in words which in truth were not for his good, addressing him as a god, and

invoking him with the cry,  Be propitious! if hitherto we have revered thee as a human being, yet

henceforth we confess thee to be superior to mortal nature.'

 "The king did not rebuke them, nor did he repudiate their impious flattery. . . .  There came also a

severe pain in his belly, beginning with a violent attack. . . . So he was carried quickly into the

palace, and the news sped abroad among all that he could certainly die before long. . . . And when

he had suffered continuously for five days from the pain in his belly, he departed this life in the

fifty-fourth year of his age and the seventh of his reign."

  <LI><B>John the Baptist</B><P>




 In Antiques xviii.5.2. we read how Herod Antipas the tetrarch of Galilee was defeated in battle by

Aretas, king of the Nabatean Arabs, the father of Herod's first wife, whom he deserted for Herodias. 

Joseph goes on to say:<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

  "Now some of the Jews thought that Herod's army had been destroyed by God, and that it was a

very just penalty to avenge John, surnamed the Baptist.  For Herod had killed him, though he was a

good man, who bade the Jews practice virtue, be just one to another and pious toward God, and

come together in baptism. He taught that baptism was acceptable to God provided that they

underwent it not to procure remission of certain sins, but for the purification of the boy, if the soul

had already been purified by righteousness.*  And when the others gathered round him (for they

were greatly moved when they heard his words), Herod feared that his persuasive power over men,

being so great, might lead to a rising, as they seemed ready to follow his counsel in everything.  So

he thought it much better to seize him and kill him before he caused any tumult, than to have to

repent of falling into such trouble later on, after a revolt had taken place.  Because of this suspicion

of Herod, John was sent in chains to Machaerus, the fortress which we mentioned above, and there

put to death.  The Jews believed that it was to avenge him that the disaster fell upon the army, God

wishing to bring evil upon Herod."

</BLOCKQUOTE>

F.F. Bruce places this comment on Josephus' quote about John the Baptist:<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

 "There are striking differences between this and the Gospel account: according to Mark 1:4, John's

 proclaimed a baptism of repentance for remission of sins', whereas Josephus says that John's

baptism was not for the remission of sin; and the story of John's death is given a political

significance by Josephus, whereas in the Gospels it resulted from John's denunciation of Herod's

marriage to Herodias.  It is quite likely that Herod thought he could kill two birds with one stone

by imprisoning John; and as for the discrepancy about the significance of John's baptism, the

independent traditions which we can trace in the New Testament are impressively unanimous, and

besides being earlier than the account in Josephus (the Antiquities were published in AD 93), they

give what is a more probable account from the religious-historical point of view.  Josephus, in fact

seem to attribute to John the baptismal doctrine of the Essenes, as known to us now from the

Qumran texts.  But the general outline of the story in Josephus confirms the Gospel record.  The

Josephus passage was known to Origen (c. 230) and to Eusebius (c. 326)."<P>

  <LI>Death of <B>James</B> "the brother of Jesus the

    so-called Christ."<P>


Later in the Antiquities (xx. 9. 1) Josephus describes the high-handed acts of the high priest

Ananus after the death of the procurator Festus (AD 61) in these words:<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

 "But the younger Ananus who, as we said, received the high priesthood, was of a bold disposition

and exceptionally daring; he followed the party of the Sadducees, who are severe in judgment above

all the Jews, as we have already shown.  As therefore Ananus was of such a disposition, he thought

he had now a good opportunity, as Festus was now dead, and Albinus was still on the road; so he

assembled a council of judges, and brought before it the brother of Jesus the so-called Christ,

whose name was James, together with some others, and having accused them as law-breakers, he

delivered them over to be stoned."</BLOCKQUOTE>

 "And there arose about this time Jesus, a wise man, if indeed we should call him a man; for he was

a doer of marvelous deeds, a teacher of men who received the truth with pleasure.  He led away man

Jews, and also many of the Greeks.  This man was the Christ. And when Pilate had condemned him

to the cross on his impeachment by the chief men among us, those who had loved him at first did

not cease; for he appeared to them on the third day alive again, the divine prophets having spoken

these and thousands of other wonderful things about him; and even now the tribe of Christians, so

named after him, has not yet died out."

</BLOCKQUOTE>

 [This text from Josephus is the same as it was in Eusebius' day, for he quotes it twice.]<P>




 One reason why many have thought this passage a Christian interpolation is that Origen says that

Josephus did not believe Jesus to be the Messiah nor proclaim Him as such.  We can be certain that

Josephus was no Christian.  But there no evidence at all against the authenticity  of this passage in

Josephus.  The manuscript evidence is as unanimous and ample as it is for anything in Josephus.<P>


 It may be however, if we look closely at this section, that Josephus was writing with his tongue in

his cheek, so to speak.  "If indeed we should call him a man" may be a sarcastic reference to the

Christian's belief in Jesus as the Son of God.  "This man was the Christ" may mean no more than

that this was the Jesus commonly called the Christ.


 Even acute critics have found no difficulty in accepting the Testimonium Flavianum as it stands. 

The passage certainly contains several characteristic features of the diction of Josephus, as has

been pointed out by the late Dr. H. St. John Thackeray (the leading British authority of Josephus in

recent years) and others.<P>

A.<B> Thallus</B> c. AD 52 <P>




  A gentile writer who wrote a work tracing the history of Greece and its relations with Asia from

the Trojan War to his own day.    (A Samaritan by the same name is mentioned by Josephus [Ant.

xviii 6. 4] as being a freedman of the Emperor Tiberius.  Whether this is the same man we are not

sure.) <P>




  Thallus wrote several works but they have all disappeared except for fragment quotes.  One

surviving quote from his third book of history  pertains to his discussion of the darkness which fell

upon the land during the crucifixion of Christ.  <P>




  "Thallus, in his third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun--

unreasonable, as it seems to me" 


 (Unreasonable, of course, because a solar eclipse could not take place at the time of the full moon,

and it was at the season of the Paschal full moon that Christ died.)<P>





 Two things we can infer:<P>




 1. That the gospel story (i.e the crucifixion and resurrection) was known in Rome in non-Christian

circles toward the middle of the first century.<P>




 2. That the enemies of Christianity tried to refute the story by  giving a naturalistic explanation to

the facts which it reported.<P>

B. Letter of Syrian<B> Mara Ben-Serapion</B> to his Son in AD 73<P>




  This interesting manuscript is preserved in the British Museum and dates to the last quarter of

the first century A.D.

  Mara Bar-Serapion was in prison at the time, but he wrote to encourage his son in the pursuit of

wisdom, and pointed out that those who persecuted wise men were overtaken by misfortune.  He

uses the examples of the deaths of Socrates, Pythagoras and Christ.<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

 "What advantage did the Athenians gain from putting Socrates to death?  Famine and plague came

upon them as a judgment for their crime.  What advantage did the men of Samos gain from burning

Pythagoras?  In a moment their land was covered with sand.  What advantage did the Jews gain

from executing their wise King?  It was just after that that their kingdom was abolished.  God

justly avenged these three wise men: the Athenians died of hunger; the Samians were overwhelmed

by the sea; the Jews, ruined and riven from their land, live in complete dispersion.  But Socrates did

not die for good; he lived on in the teaching of Plato.  Pythagoras did not die for good; he lived on

in the statue of Hera.  Nor did the wise King die for good; He lived on in the teaching which He had

given."

 It is evident that this writer was not a Christian or he would have said the Christ lived on by being

raised from the dead.  He was more probably a Gentile philosopher, who accepted the thoughts of

the Greek philosophers of placing Christ on a comparable footing with the great sages of antiquity.<P>

imperial archives.<BR>

If he did make a report, what did it contain?  If he made such a report it has disappeared. <BR>

 


    It is certain that some ancient writers believe that Pilate did send in such a report, but there is

no direct quote from them about its contents.<P>

E. <B>Cornelius Tacitus</B> b. AD 52  History of Rome<P>




  The greatest Roman historian in the days of the Empire.<P>


    He was born between AD 52 and 54 and wrote the history of Rome under the emperors.

   At the age of sixty, when writing the history of the reign of Nero (AD 54-68), he described the

great fire which ravaged Rom in AD 64 and told how it was widely rumored that Nero had

instigated the fire, in order to gain greater glory for himself by rebuilding the city.  He goes on to

say:<P>




 <BLOCKQUOTE>"Therefore, to scotch the rumor, Nero substituted as culprits, and punished with the utmost

refinements of cruelty, a class of men, loathed for their vices, whom the crowd styled Christians. 

Christus, from whom they got their name, had been executed by sentence of the procurator Pontius

Pilate when Tiberius was emperor; and the pernicious superstition was checked for a short time,

only to break out afresh, not only in Judea, the home of the plague, but in Rome itself, where all

the horrible and shameful things in the world collect and find a home."

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


 It does not appear to us that Tacitus got his information from either Christian or Jewish sources

for his references to Jesus as Christus.  For the pagan Tacitus, Christus was simply a proper name,

but for Jews and Christians it was not a name but a title.<P>


 If Pilate did send a report to Rome, Tacitus was in such a position to have access to such official

information.  But his language is too summary to make any such inference certain.<P>




 One point is worth noting, however; apart from Jewish and Christian writers, Tacitus is the one

and only Roman author to mention Pilate.  It may surely be accounted one of the ironies of history

that the only mention Pilate receives from a Roman historian is in connection with the part he

played in the execution of Jesus!<P>

   Most scholars believe that the strife among the Roman Jews at that time was due to the recent

Jewish quarreling over one Chrestus (a variant spelling of Christius in Gentile circles), inferred

wrongly that this person was actually in Rome himself in the time of Claudius.<P>

G.<B> C. Plinius Secundus</B> -- (Pliny the Younger)   AD 62 - 113<P>




 Pliny the Younger was asked by the Emperor Trajan about 111 to accept a mission to Bithynia, in

northern Asia Minor as legate and governor.  Pliny devoted himself to reorganizing the somewhat

run-to-seed province with a touching, if somewhat timorous, zeal.  <P>


 

 Governor of Bithynia<P>

  According to evidence he had secured by examining some of them under torture . . .<P>

 ". . . It is my custom, my lord, to refer to you all questions about which I have doubts.  Who,

indeed, can better direct me in hesitation, or enlighten me in ignorance?  In the examination of

Christians I have never taken part; therefore I do not know what crime is usually punished or

investigated ro to what extent.  So I have no little uncertainty . . .   Meanwhile I have taken this

course with those who were accused before me as Christians: I have asked them whether they were

Christians.  Those who confessed I asked a second and a third time, threatening punishment. 

Those who persisted I ordered led away to execution.  For I did not doubt that, whatever it was they

admitted, obstinacy and unbending perversity certainly deserve to be punished.  There were others

of the like insanity, but because they were Roman citizens I noted them down to be sent to Rome. 

Soon after this, as it often happens, because the matter was taken notice of, the crime became wise-spread and many cases arose.  An unsigned paper was presented containing the names of many. 

But these denied that they were or had been Christians, and I thought it right to let them go, since

at my dictation they prayed to the gods and made supplication with incense and wine to your

statue, which I had ordered to be brought into the court for the purpose, together with the images

of the gods, and in addition to this they cursed Christ, none of which things, it is said, those who

are really Christians can be made to do.  Others who were named by an informer said that they

were Christians, and soon afterward denied it, saying, indeed, that they had been, but had ceased to

be Christians, some three years ago, some many years, and one even twenty years ago.  All these

also not only worshiped your statue and the images of the gods, but also cursed Christ.  They

asserted, however that the amount of their fault or error was this: that they has been accustomed to

assemble on a fixed day before day light and sing by turns [i.e. antiphonally] a hymn to Christ as a

god; and that they bound themselves with an oath, not for any crime, but to commit neither theft,

nor robbery, nor adultery, not to break their word and not to deny a deposit when demanded; after

these things were done, it was their custom to depart and meet together again to take food, but

ordinary and harmless food; . . .  For many of every age, every rank, and even of both sexes, are

brought into danger; and will be in the future.  The contagion of that superstition has penetrated

not only the cities but also the villages and country places... At any rate, it is certain enough that
