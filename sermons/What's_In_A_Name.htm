<p>Introduction:</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">1.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>One of the pet statements bandied about by those who would defend denominationalism is, &#8220;There
isn&#8217;t anything in a name.&#8221;  The purpose of this sermon is to look at what <i>God has said</i> on the subject
of the name; what <i>you or I may think</i> about it amounts to nothing if God has spoken.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">2.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>It is my intention to be practical throughout this discussion; indeed I fear I may be too practical for
some.  I shall deal with actual conditions.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>a.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I will assume there are in this assembly people who have had some connection with or who
are affiliated with denominational bodies, and are known as Lutherans, Episcopalians,
Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, etc.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>b.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>It is not my intention to ridicule their faith.  Whenever I shall use such terms as &#8220;the Lutheran
Church,&#8221; &#8220;the Methodist Church,&#8221; etc., I shall do so, not in any spirit of ridicule, but to make
myself clearly understood.  I pray that you will listen to the Scriptures in the same spirit of
sincerity.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><i>1  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Denominationalism defined</span></i></span>.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">1.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In every community, there are different bodies of people, all professing to be Christians, all singing
practically the same hymns, all praying to the same God in the name of the same Mediator, all
fervent in spirit and earnest in zeal, and all animated by the same Christian ideas of life; yet
worshiping in different chapels, and separated from one another by denominational walls of human
origin.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">2.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>This is not theory nor speculation, but an honest statement of the condition that actually exists.   The
condition itself may be termed <i>sectarianism,</i> or <i>denominationalism or denominational Christianity.</i></p>
<br>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><i><span style="font-weight: bold">2. The attitude of Jesus towards division</span></i></span><i>.</i> </p>
<br>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The question now arises, Is this condition pleasing to the Lord?  Has Jesus said anything on the
subject?  In the 17<sup>th</sup> chapter of John&#8217;s narrative of the gospel the real Lord&#8217;s prayer is recorded, the one
which He prayed Himself, not that which He taught His disciples to pray.  </p>
<br>
<p><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>After praying for the sanctification of His apostles, He says:  <i><span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;Neither for these only do I pray, but
for them also that believe on me through their word; that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, art
in me, and I in thee, that they may also be in us:  that the world may believe that thou didst send me,&#8221; </span></i>
John 17:20-21.  An analysis of this prayer reveals the following truths:</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">(1)  <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>He prayed that all who believe on Him through the apostles&#8217; word <i>may be one.</i>  This includes all
believers in Christ in all ages, as we have no other evidence to convince us that He is the Christ
except the apostles&#8217; testimony.  John 20:30-31; Acts 2:42; Acts 16:31-33; rom. 10:14-17.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">(2) <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>He prayed that this oneness might be of such a nature as that existed between the Father and
Himself.  This would be oneness of <span style="text-decoration: underline">plan</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">purpose</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">effort </span>and relationship.  this would not be a unity
arrived at by mutual compromise and concession, but a unity achieved by the complete surrender of
individual will to the divine Will; in other words, a unity consummated by bringing all believers <i>into
Christ</i> in the Scriptural way.  Rom. 8:1; Gal. 3:27.  Such a oneness would necessarily include unity
of faith, practice and worship.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">(3)<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>This prayer teaches that such a oneness can be attained when believers are brought into a
relationship with God, through Christ, in the way taught in the Scriptures. Rom. 10:9-10; 2Cor.
7:10; Gal. 3:27; 2Cor. 5:17.  &#8220;That they may be one in us&#8221; is the nature of the unity for which Jesus
prayed.  We can readily see that such a unity is not achieved by any &#8220;league of denominations;&#8221;  it
can be realized only in the unity of all disciples in the <i>faith and worship outlined in the New
Testament.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">(4)  <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>It is also quite evident that such a oneness must be <i>visible</i>.  Someone may say, &#8220;But we are already
one.  We may have denominations on earth, but we are one in faith and shall be united in heaven.&#8221; 
Jesus prayed that we may be one, however, that the world may believe.  A unity that will convince
the world must be a visible unity.  If the <i>world</i> is won for Christ, denominationalism must go, and all
disciples must become one in the faith and worship authorized by the New Testament.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">(5)<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The purpose of this oneness is &#8220;<i>that the world may believe&#8221;. </i>  Jesus knew quite well that a divided
body would be ineffective in winning the world to His standard.  Hence He has left this prayer on the
divine record that His disciples may know His will in the matter.  We must admit that Christianity
has thus far failed to convert the world, and that the reason lies in its divisions and humanisms.  John
R. Mott has rightly said, &#8220;The price that has been paid for a divided Christendom is an unbelieving
world.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">(6)<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Think what power would be exerted in the Rogersville community if there all believers were united
in one faith and practice and worship.  Imagine the effect on the Rogersville community if all the
talents of all the men and women professing to be disciples of Jesus Christ were committed to using
their talents and resources to teach the gospel, and demonstrate the way by our lives and our unity.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>a.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Someone may argue that I am picturing an impossibility; that men can never be brought to
such genuine agreement.  Do you think that Jesus was praying for an impossibility?    </p>
<p style="text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>b.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Moreover if the unity for which Jesus prayed is not attained, it will be so because men make
it impossible by their prejudices and putting their will ahead of the will of our Lord.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>c,<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Be that as it may, the fact remains that such an ideal of unity has been set before us by the
Lord, and we cannot be loyal disciples of Him unless we earnestly strive to achieve the ideal.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">(7) <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>It becomes quite plain, after analyzing this prayer, that any one who seeks to perpetuate
denominationalism, or a divided Christianity, is acting in direct opposition to the will of Christ.  The
condition existing at the present time in the religious world is the direct antithesis of that for which
Christ prayed.  And I&#8217;m afraid that those who are responsible, therefore, for maintaining this division
will be held accountable in the judgment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">(8) <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Let me illustrate:  The church is referred to as the body of Christ, in  Eph. 1:23.  Suppose someone
should attack you, tear off an arm, break a bone, punch out an eye, or mangle a limb, would your
body be as powerful in such a condition as it its present state of health?  No.  Neither can the body of
Christ be powerful when torn apart by denominationalism.</p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">3.  <i>The question of name as related to division</i></span></span><i>.</i>  </p>

<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">1.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>It is very clear that Jesus taught that  the church is to be one body.  Denominationalism then is not
only a waste of time, talent and energy, but it is sinful itself being contrary to our Lord&#8217;s will.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>a.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span> Let us now be practical.  Suppose the different church bodies in this community should
decide to unite.  Suppose, again, that you were to be placed on a committee to formulate the
plan of unity.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>b.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>What would probably be the first question this committee would be compelled to consider? 
Strange to say it would not be any such question as, for instance, predestination, or the
operation of the Holy Spirit, or even baptism.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>c.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>It would be:  <i>What shall be the name of this united church?</i></p>

<p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in">2.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>At this point a clear-cut question comes to our mind!  <i>Has God already provided a name for His
church and His people?</i>  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>a.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>If so, is it not within the jurisdiction of any committee of men to change that name or to
select another?  Men have no authority in matters wherein God has spoken.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>b.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Or, <i>Has God left the matter of naming His church and His people to the people themselves?</i> 
If so, your committee would have a perfect right to select any name upon which all may
agree.  </p>
<p style="text-indent: -1in; margin-left: 1in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>c.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>To settle this issue an investigation into the Scriptures would be in order.</p>

If the church is the body of Christ, she must have the same name as her head.  It would be strange if my
body and my head should bear different names.  In some comments on the passage, &#8216;The disciples were
called Christians first at Antioch,&#8217; it is held that this name was given in derision.  I think not.  If you study
the use of the Greek word, &#8216;called&#8217;, you will conclude that they were divinely called Christians.  God gave
them that name.  Jesus speaks about rich men blaspheming that &#8216;beautiful name by which you are called.&#8217;&#8221;  </p>

a sectarian church came to her soliciting help to liquidate a debt against their building. She told him she
could not contribute money to the spread of sectarianism, but he answered; &#8216;There is noting in a name; we
are all striving for the same end.&#8217;  She then wrote out her check for a thousand dollars and handed it to the
preacher, and with a heart full of joy he quickly make his way to the back for the money.  The cashier
refused to accept the check.  &#8216;Why,&#8217; said he, &#8216;this was given to me by Mrs. Taubman and her credit is good.&#8217; 
The cashier replied, &#8216;Her name is not signed to the check.&#8217;  The preacher examined it and found that she has
signed the name of her servant.  He went back to Sister Taubman, told her of her mistake, but she replied,
&#8220;There is nothing in a name, so you say, and that check ought to be just as good with the name of my
servant on it as my own.&#8217;  The preacher had a practical demonstration of the inconsistency of his argument.&#8221;
