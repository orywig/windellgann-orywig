        <p align="JUSTIFY">The colorful sixteenth century came to an end with
        the death of Queen Elizabeth I in 1603. The English Church was now
        definitely separated from the Church of Rome; England and Scotland were
        united under the crown of King James I; English literature was bursting
        into full flower with Shakespeare, Bacon, and Spenser. One of the first
        tasks which King James faced was the reconciliation of various religious
        parties. One of their more serious differences of opinion was over the
        Bible versions. The Bishops' Bible and the Great Bible were in use in
        the churches, but the Puritans, who were in ascendancy, were buying the
        Geneva Bible. The Bishops' Bible was the Authorized Version but it was a
        poor translation. King James liked the Geneva Bible as a translation but
        the many marginal notes which attacked the King were objectionable. No
        one knew just what faction James would uphold.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In January 1604, King James called a conference of
        leading religious leaders at Hampton Court to promote religious
        toleration. Amid the discussion, Dr. John Reynolds, President of Corpus
        Christi College, Oxford, spokesman for the Puritan group, proposed a new
        translation that would have the approval of the whole church. Most
        present took little notice of the suggestion with the exception of King
        James who was himself somewhat a Bible scholar and had even done some
        translation.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">On July 22, 1604, the king announced that he had
        appointed 54 men as translators of new version. The list included
        Anglican churchmen, Puritan churchmen, linguists and theologians
        (including some who were uncommitted to either religious party), laymen
        and ministers. And these translators had the privilege of calling on any
        scholar outside their committee if they should desire.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A list of 47 of the men has been preserved with the
        company they served. The other seven appear to have died or resigned
        before the work began. One of the most valuable Hebrew scholars, Dr.
        Lively, died in 1605 before the translating work started. (Hills, p. 21)</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The Revisers were organized into six companies; two
        meeting at Westminster, two at Cambridge, and two at Oxford. The
        companies were made up of seven or eight of the greatest Hebrew and
        Greek scholars of the day. Each company was given a section of scripture
        with which to start. Each man made his own translation and they then
        compared and revised them into one version which then went to each of
        the other companies for review. Thus every part of the Bible went
        through the hands of the entire body of revisers. Then the entire
        version, thus, amended, came before a selected committee of twelve, two
        from each company. They ironed out ultimate differences and put the
        finishing touches, the harmonistic elements, upon the work and prepared
        it for the printer. (Miller, p. 364)</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The King gave the revisers a set of 15 rules to
        govern their work. A gist of a few of them being:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2">
        <blockquote>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">1. The Bishops' Bible shall be followed and as
          little altered as the truth of the original will permit.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <dir>
          <li>
            <p align="JUSTIFY">2. The old ecclesiastical words shall be
            retained.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</li>
          <li>
            <p align="JUSTIFY">3. The chapter divisions shall not be changed,
            unless very necessary.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</li>
          <li>
            <p align="JUSTIFY">4. No marginal notes at all, except explanation
            of Hebrew and Greek words which cannot be briefly and fitly
            expressed in the text.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</li>
          <li>
            <p align="JUSTIFY">5. Whenever the Tyndale, Matthew, Coverdale, the
            Great Bible, or the Geneva agrees better with the text than the
            Bishops' Bible, they are to be used.</li>

        <p align="CENTER">II. Early Editions</p>
        </b></font><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>The translation was proposed in January 1604, began in 1607, took two
        years to accomplish and nine months more to prepare for the printer. The
        first edition appeared with an engraved title page, a dedication to King
        James, a Preface to the Reader, genealogies, maps, and other popular
        features. The engravings were from previously published Bibles and
        classic books. The pages were unnumbered but there were 1668 of them. It
        was a stately folio edition measuring 16 x 10½ inches, and was intended
        to be a &quot;pulpit&quot; edition.</p>
        <p>There is no evidence to show that the version ever had the official
        approval or authority of King James. Evidently the printers on their own
        authority had been using the phrase &quot;Authorized and Appointed to be
        Read in the Churches&quot; on copies of the Bishops' Bible to
        distinguish it from the Geneva Bible. They continued the same use with
        the new version. Thus the phrase &quot;Authorized Version&quot; used as
        a label to distinguish it from other versions was not a historical
        reality. It appears that the king never even made a contribution toward
        financing the operation.</p>
        <p>Three editions of the KJV appeared during the first year. In the next
        three years fourteen editions in various sizes were printed. As to be
        expected under early printing methods, there were many typographical
        errors in every edition. As old ones were corrected, new ones appeared.
        Some were quite humorous and some serious.</p>
        <p>One of the 1611 editions had &quot;I Corinthians&quot; and &quot;2
        Corinthians&quot; listed in the Old Testament instead of Chronicles. But
        of all the misprints the KJV suffered, none were as scandalous as the
        omission of the word <i>&quot;not&quot;</i> from the seventh
        commandment, hence the offending edition was commonly called the <b><i>Wicked
        Bible.</b></i> Another edition was called the <b><i>Vinegar Bible</b></i>
        because the chapter heading of Luke 20 which read <b><i>vinegar</b></i>
        instead of <b><i>vineyard.</b></i> The <b><i>Murderers' Bible</b></i>
        was so called because Mark 7:27 was made to read &quot;<i>Let the
        children first be killed&quot;</i> instead of <i>filled.</i> Another
        misprint read &quot;<i>he slew two lions like men</i>&quot; (2 Samuel
        23:20). The moral of all this was pointed up most effectually by the
        careless typesetter who made Psalms 119:161 read, <i>&quot;Printers have
        persecuted me without a cause&quot;</i>!</p>
        <p>The classic misprint which has been perpetuated by modern editions is
        Matthew 23:24, &quot;<i>strain at a gnat</i>&quot; instead of &quot;<i>strain
        out a gnat.&quot;</p>
        </i>
        <p>Our present edition of the KJV comes from revisions made in 1762 by
        Dr. Thomas Paris of Trinity College for Cambridge Press, and 1769 by Dr.
        Benjamin Blayney for the Oxford Press. These revisions primarily
        modernized spelling.</p>

        <p align="CENTER">III. The Reception of the KJV</p>
        </b></font><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>The new version began to be used immediately in all the churches
        through the people continued to hold on to the older versions in their
        private reading. Kenyon says, &quot;From the first, however, the version
        of 1611 seems to have been received into popular favor.&quot; (Kenyon,
        p. 232). Some believe it was forty years before the KJV won out over the
        popularity of the Geneva Bible.</p>
        <p>The publishers added their contribution to the success of the KJV by
        ceasing the publication of the Bishops' Bible in 1606 and by issuing the
        KJV with the same format as the Geneva Bible.</p>
        <p>But the Roman Catholics accused it of being false to the scriptures
        in favor of protestantism; Armenians thought it favored Calvinism; the
        Puritans would have preferred to use &quot;<i>washing</i>&quot; instead
        of &quot;<i>baptism</i>&quot;, and &quot;<i>congregation</i>&quot; or
        &quot;<i>assembly</i>&quot; instead of &quot;<i>church</i>.&quot; They
        also disliked the words &quot;<i>bishops,&quot; &quot;ordain,&quot; and
        &quot;Easter.</i>&quot;</p>
        <p>The reasons for the gradual but overwhelming success of the KJV have
        been well stated by several writers and may be briefly summarized as
        follows:</p>
        <dir>
        </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
        <li></font><font face="Arial" size="2">1. The personal qualifications of
        the revisers, who were the choice scholars and linguists of their day as
        well as men of profound and unaffected piety.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</li>
          <li>2. The almost universal sense of the work as a national effort,
            supported wholehearted by the king, and with the full concurrence
            and approval of both church and state.</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>3. It was the work of no single man and of no single school. It
            was the deliberate work of a large body of trained scholars who had
            before them nearly a century of revision. The translation of the
            Bible had passed out of the sphere of controversy. It was a national
            undertaking in which no one had any interest at heart save that of
            producing the best possible version of the scriptures.</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>4. The congeniality of the religious climate of the day with the
            sympathies and enthusiasm of the translators, as the predominate
            interest of their age was theology and religion.</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>5. The organized system of cooperative work which followed the
            precedent of the Geneva translators, while it may have been
            improved, resulted in a unity of tone in the Authorized Version
            which surpassed all its predecessors.</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>6. The literary atmosphere of the late sixteenth and early
            seventeenth centuries paralleled the lofty sense of style and
            artistic tough of the translators. (Geisler, p. 420)</li>

        <p align="CENTER">IV. The Greek Text of the KJV</p>
        </b></font><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>Champions of recent versions have tried to disparage the Greek text
        from which the KJV was made. These men are usually theological liberals,
        or trained under them, such as Clarence T. Craig who was on the
        translation committee of the RSV. He says on page 15 of the <u>Introduction
        to the Revised Standard Version</u> (a book published by the RSV
        translation committee), &quot;The King James Version....was based on
        late and corrupt medieval manuscripts.&quot; And thus, he attacks the
        foundation of the KJV, supposing the RSV by using the &quot;two most
        ancient&quot; MSS and the Dead Sea Scrolls have a superior text.</p>
        <p>The Greek text that formed the basis for the King James Version has
        since been given the name <b><i>Textus Receptus</b></i>. This is a Greek
        edition based on the Byzantine family of MSS. Some in attacking this
        particular edition point out that it is partially based upon the work of
        Desiderius Erasmus of 1516, who had no MSS older than the X century, and
        who had only one XII century MS on Revelation. We know from Erasmus that
        the last six verses of his Revelation MS were missing and that he
        translated it from a Latin Bible into Greek and incorporated it into his
        Greek edition.</p>
        <p>But one must realize that the Textus Receptus had undergone other
        revisions. The text from Erasmus was his 5th edition of 1535, not his
        first of 1516. It had also been revised and as a result is also called
        Stephen's &quot;royal edition&quot; of 1550 with marginal reading from
        15 MSS.</p>
        <p>Even Robertson after saying some disparaging things about it, says,
        &quot;It should be stated at once that the <i>Textus Receptus</i> is not
        a bad text. It is not a heretical text. It is substantially
        correct.&quot; (Miller, p. 364)</p>
        <p>We have in this century seen a lot of liberties taken with the Bible
        text. Men who have no reverence for God or his word do not blink about
        changing it to fit their pet theories. No example serves any better than
        the very first verse of the Bible. The KJV and the ASV translate it
        &quot;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&quot; But
        the slow, deliberate, tactic of liberals can be easily traced as they
        work to alter the scripture. First, see the RSV footnote. After
        suggesting that it could be &quot;When God began to create,&quot; the
        tactic is to let a few years go by while the public gets use to the
        change and then the liberals put the footnote into the text. See C.H.
        Dodd's translation of the New English Bible (NEB). (Many of Thayer's
        radical footnotes in the ASV get into the text of the RSV.) But how did
        the liberals arrive at this change in Genesis 1:1? The KJV and the ASV
        translators treat Genesis 1:1 as it appears in the Hebrew, an
        independent clause. The liberal radicals would change it to a dependent
        clause wherein &quot;the doctrine of absolute creation is then not
        taught in the first chapter of Genesis.&quot; (Young, p. 2) How can they
        do so? By stating they believe the Hebrew verb construction (a
        construct) is incorrect and taking the liberty to &quot;emend,&quot; or
        correct, the Hebrew to what they believe is right, and without any MS
        support. Edward J. Young points out conclusively that &quot;It is not
        necessary, however, to emend the word, because the construct followed by
        a finite verb is a genuine Semitic usage.&quot; He then proceeds to
        point out several other identical Hebrew verb constructions in the Old
        Testament. (Young, p. 3).</p>
        <p>In speaking of new translations taking liberties with the text, Foy
        E. Wallace says of &quot;the Revised Standard Version... its text is
        full of interpolations with added words and phrases unknown to any
        Scripture text.&quot; (Wallace, p.xxvii).</p>
        <p>The vast majority of extant Greek New Testament manuscripts agree
        together very closely. So closely, in fact, that they may fairly be said
        to contain the same New Testament text. This majority text is usually
        called the <b><i>Byzantine</b></i> text by modern textual critics. This
        is because all modern critics acknowledge that this was the Greek New
        Testament in general use throughout the greater part of the Byzantine
        Period (AD 312 - AD 1453). For many centuries before the protestant
        reformation this Byzantine text was the text of the entire Greek Church
        and for more than three centuries after the reformation it was the text
        of the entire protestant church. Even today it is the text which most
        protestants know best, since the King James Version and other early
        protestant translations were made from it. (Burgon, p. 20).</p>
        <p>We believe that the Bible teaches providential preservation of the
        scriptures (Matthew 24:35; Mark 13:31; Luke 21:33). Where and how has it
        been preserved?</p>
        <p>John Burgon was an ardent defender of the Byzantine text. He believed
        that Christ had fulfilled His promise of preserving His word for His
        people by handing down the Byzantine text (the Majority-Text) generation
        after generation without fail from the days of the apostles.</p>
        <p>In attacks on the KJV by way of its Greek text, many have made the
        point that the KJV was made before the discovery of the three present
        oldest manuscripts. These three being: <b>A</b>, or <i>Alexandrinus,</i>
        a fourth or fifth century manuscript; <b>B</b>, <i>Vaticanus,</i> of the
        fourth century; and <b>Aleph</b> ( </font><b><font face="WP Hebrew David">!</b></font><font face="Times New Roman">
        ), <i>Sinaiticus</i>, of the fourth or fifth century. <b>B</b> and <b>Aleph</b>
        are not of the Byzantine family, however, but are of a class referred to
        as the Alexandrian or Egyptian text.</p>
        <p>Thus, many recent translations footnote some verses, &quot;<i>Some
        ancient authorities say ...&quot;</i> and attempt to alter the
        Majority-Text reading in favor of <b>B</b> and <b>Aleph.</b> But what
        support are these &quot;ancient&quot; manuscripts for changing the
        scriptures?</p>
        <p>Burgon regarded the exceptional age of <b>B</b> and <b>Aleph</b> as a
        proof not of their goodness but of their badness. Arguing if they had
        been good manuscripts they would have been read to pieces long ago.
        &quot;We suspect that these two manuscripts are indebted for their
        preservation <i>solely</i> to their ascertained evil character.&quot; (Burgon,
        p. 23). Thus, the fact that <b>B</b> and <b>Aleph</b> are so old is a
        point against them, not something in their favor. It shows that the
        church rejected them and did not read or copy them.</p>
        <p>Even the liberal Kirsopp Lake admitted that the scribes &quot;usually
        destroyed their exemplars when they had copied the sacred books.&quot;
        If Lake could believe this, why can't he believe that the most &quot;<i>ancient</i>&quot;
        Byzantine texts were worn out with much reading and copying?</p>
        <p>Is it not odd that these ancient manuscripts <b>B</b> and <b>Aleph</b>
        are not forms which are preserved in a multitude of copies?</p>
        <p>Also note that Egypt alone has a climate favorable to the
        preservation of most ancient texts, and indeed, even the oldest extant
        Byzantine text <b>A</b>, <i>Alexandrinus,</i> was discovered at
        Alexandria.</p>
        <p>Foy E. Wallace documents on p. 637 that Tischendorf, the discoverer
        of the Sinaitic Manuscript (<b>Aleph</b>) has testified that <b>B</b>
        and <b>Aleph</b> bear evidence of having been prepared by the same hand,
        and in various portions the <b>Aleph</b> represents imperfect copying of
        <b>B</b>, and is therefore not an independent manuscript.</p>
        <p>Note the basis of the RSV and the TEV for leaving off the last twelve
        verses of Mark and the weight of their evidences, or lack of it.</p>
        <p>It is good to note that in the last few years more Greek scholars are
        coming back to recognize the superiority of the Majority-Text over these
        &quot;ancient&quot; but heretical texts. For example, in John there are
        no less than thirteen places where the new American Bible Society's Text
        (c. 1966) has changed the reading of the Nestle text <i>back to</i> the
        reading of the Textus Receptus. Also, another leading textual scholar,
        G.D. Kilpatrick, has recently been defending a surprising number of
        Majority-text reading. (Hodges, p. 14).</p>
        <p>Though the Textus Receptus reflects the Majority-Text better than any
        other kind of printed text, it is not perfect. Our present edition,
        especially in the book of Revelation, needs to be revised using all the
        Byzantine MSS now available.</p>

        <b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
        <p align="CENTER">V. Points of Scholarship</p>
        </b></font><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>There are more impressive points of scholarship surrounding the KJV
        than any other translation to date. We would like to enumerate a few of
        them in a brief fashion.</p>
        <p><b>First</b>, impressive is the very number of men and their piety
        who worked on the KJV; fifty-four men were appointed as opposed to
        thirty-one, for example, for the RSV. Also the men translating the KJV
        were the best, the most respected, and were godly men who revered the
        scriptures as the word of God. The major modern translation, the RSV,
        cannot make such a claim. Its committee was made up primarily of
        theological liberals and unbelievers who reject the basic cardinal
        doctrines of the Bible.</p>
        <p><b>Second</b>, the KJV translators wanted to translate the scriptures
        without giving a commentary on it. They left the interpretation to the
        reader. This is a prime factor in its universal acceptance. King James
        was wise enough to see that the Bible is not a sectarian book. Thus,
        superfluous notes in the margin were eliminated and those that appear
        have to do only with the Hebrew and Greek words.</p>
        <p><b>Third</b>, when the KJV translators found it necessary to supply a
        word in English to complete the meaning they indicated such supplied
        words by the use of italics. The King James Version was not the first
        version to use such a technique; italics first appeared in the Geneva
        Bible (AD 1557-60). The ASV followed this procedure but the RSV supplied
        so many words not in the Greek or Hebrew it would be too cumbersome so
        they omitted the practice. (Cf. Wallace, p. xxvii). Certainly this is
        another major point of scholarship the KJV has over modern versions.</p>
        <p><b>Fourth</b>, the Hebrew Old Testament has a tetragrammaton for the
        personal name of God. It was so sacred the Hebrews never uttered it. It
        was </font><b><font face="HebraicaII" size="4">hwhy</b></font><font face="HebraicaII">
        </font><font face="Times New Roman">(YHWH), and when they came to it
        they gave it the pronunciation of <b><i>adonai</b></i> &quot;lord&quot;
        and indicated this by giving </font><font face="HebraicaII" size="4">hwhy</font><font face="Times New Roman">
        the vowel markings of <i>adonai</i>, (thus </font><font face="HebraicaII" size="4">hw:hyÒ</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
        </font><font face="Times New Roman">) and when in the context with <i>adonai</i>
        they gave it the pronunciation of <b><i>elohim</b></i> &quot;God&quot;
        and the vowels of <i>elohim</i> (</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
        </font><font face="HebraicaII" size="4">hwIhyÒ</font><font face="Times New Roman">
        ).</p>
        <p>The KJV approached this matter and showed the best scholarship of any
        translation known. When they came to</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
        </font><font face="HebraicaII" size="4">hw:hyÒ</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
        </font><font face="Times New Roman">they used the word &quot;LORD&quot;
        in all caps indicating it was the tetragrammaton pronounced as <i>adonai</i>
        &quot;lord&quot;, and for </font><font face="HebraicaII">hwIhyÒ</font><font face="Times New Roman">
        they used &quot;GOD&quot; in all caps showing it was the tetragrammaton
        pronounced as <i>elohim.</i> What a marvelous technique, so similar and
        parallel to the Hebrew itself!</p>
        <p>Here the ASV falls quite short. Instead of following the KJV they
        proceeded to try and translate YHWH by &quot;Jehovah&quot; an old
        unscholarly pronunciation from the medieval period. (The KJV used
        &quot;Jehovah&quot; in four instances, Exodus 6:3; Psalm 83:18; Isaiah
        12:2; 26:4). The best way to translate the name of God appears to be as
        &quot;Yahweh.&quot; But according to which vowels one supplies there are
        about fifteen variations in pronouncing it.</p>
        <p>Here the RSV and NEB recognized the weakness of &quot;Jehovah&quot;
        and returned to following the scholarly method of the KJV.</p>
        <p><b>Fifth</b>, another feature of the printed format of the KJV that
        many like and some attack is that each verse notation begins at the left
        of the column. This feature makes it possible to find a passage more
        rapidly. Some object that you cannot tell where the major breaks appear
        in the scripture. But they fail to notice the ¶ symbol which indicates
        the break or paragraph.</p>
        <p>The shortcoming of this is that the KJV has the ¶ marks only through
        Acts 20. It has been puzzling why the ¶ symbols stop at this point. One
        person suggested &quot;perhaps the printer ran out of these signs.&quot;
        But a good reply to this was: &quot;That suggestion implies that the
        type for the whole book was set up before printing, as is the practice
        today, the stocks of the hand-cut type then used were so small that
        usually only four pages were set up and printed, the type then being
        distributed in order to set up the next four, and so on throughout;
        therefore the long-suffering printer would have just as many ¶ marks
        for the end as for the start of the Bible.&quot; (Bruce, p. 108).</p>
        <p>The better reply is that it appears the last thing the KJV committee
        did in preparing it for the printer was to insert the ¶ markings. One
        report suggests that King James may have become impatient and ordered
        them to get it printed and they did not have time to complete that task.</p>
        <p>The American Bible Society has printed an edition of the KJV in
        paragraph format similar to the ASV and RSV. But generally, even modern
        printed KJV Bibles end the ¶ markings with Acts 20.</p>
        <p><b>Sixth</b>, another printing format of the KJV continued by the ASV
        but dropped by most other modern versions were the verbs with the suffix
        &quot;-eth&quot;. Most modern translators say the &quot;-eth&quot;
        ending sound archaic. (Such as <i>goeth, doeth, abideth.</i>) But there
        was a reason behind the KJV use of this form. The Merriam-Webster New
        Collegiate Dictionary says the &quot;-eth&quot; was &quot;The Middle
        English ending of the present indicative third person singular.&quot;
        (P. 283).</p>
        <p>The Greek present tense was the tense of continuous (or linear
        ---&gt; ) action, while the aorist showed punctiliar () action. The
        distinction between the present and aorist is sometimes lost in some
        modern translations. Others, intent on showing the continuous action of
        the present indicative use an English participle (i.e. &quot;doing&quot;
        &quot;going&quot; &quot;abiding&quot;). But then, how will you show the
        Greek present participle?</p>
        <p>The KJV clearly is superior for the student who wants the distinction
        between the present indicative, the aorist, and the present participle.
        The KJV is a scholarly translation.</p>
        <p><b>Seventh</b>, another helpful aid of the KJV is the distinction
        between the second person singular and plural pronouns. In English one
        cannot tell if &quot;you&quot; is singular or plural (a weakness of many
        modern translations, one of which puts a footnote on nearly every
        &quot;you&quot; to tell if it is singular or plural). But the KJV makes
        the distinction by the use of &quot;thou - ye.&quot; Again, many people
        think of it as archaic style and fail to note the reason and the
        superiority of such usage. But in the KJV &quot;thou and thee&quot; are
        second person singular, while &quot;ye and you&quot; are reserved for
        the plural.</p>
        <p><b>Eight</b>, another point of superiority which we have already
        noted elsewhere is the reliance upon the Majority-Text (Byzantine)
        rather than a heavily interpolated text.</p>
        <p>These, briefly, are a few of the points favoring the KJV.</p>

        <b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
        <p align="CENTER">VI. Criticism of the KJV</p>
        </b></font><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>Foy E. Wallace says that &quot;the objections and criticism flung at
        the old version center on (1) archaisms, obsolete words and archaic
        phrases; (2) the word <i>Easter</i> in Acts 12:4; (3) on Matthew 28:19,
        the translation of the Greek preposition <i>eis</i> by the English
        preposition &quot;in&quot; (Wallace p. xxiii). When critics claim there
        are &quot;hundreds of errors in the King James Bible&quot; it impresses
        a class room of students but honest scholars agree that these alleged
        errors relate only to syntax, consisting of variations in grammar,
        sentence structure, punctuation and ancient spellings, all of which
        means &quot;there are <b><i>no errors in teaching and doctrine</b></i>&quot;
        (Wallace, p. xxiv).</p>
        <p>Some have criticized the KJV for being biased toward Calvinism. But
        as Wallace points out &quot;...it is the Authorized King James Version
        with which we have refuted Calvinism at every point and turn in the
        polemics of oral debate and written discussion. That charge is another
        senseless assertion. These assaults on the Authorized Version are
        actually attacks on the Bible itself under the pretense and disguise of
        rejecting 'that old version'--&quot; (Wallace, p. xxvi).</p>
        <p>Some of the scholars working on new, modern versions complain that
        the KJV is too difficult for people to understand. But as one preacher
        pointed out in a class room, his grandfather, and many other great
        preachers with him, never completed a formal education and they had no
        difficulty understanding the KJV. Strange that modern educated scholars
        can't understand it! Of course, the reason they can't understand it is
        that it doesn't read the way they want it to read. And the modern way to
        do things is to publish a new, sectarian Bible that has your creed in
        it. (Note the tract <u>Putting the Creed in the Bible.)</p>
        </u>
        <p>Some preachers, giving ear to the ASV and RSV and other modern
        versions, assert that the term church (<b><i>te ekklesia</i>)</b> is not
        in the Greek New Testament in Acts 2:47 and that the KJV is incorrect in
        placing it there. This is a misleading statement. The term <b><i>te
        ekklesia</b></i> is in the Textus Receptus, from which the KJV was
        translated; it is in the Greek New Testament of the <u>Expositor's Greek
        New Testament</u> by W. Nicoll Robertson; in the Greek New Testament of
        Berry's Interlinear, and in the <u>Reviser's Greek Text</u>, by Whitney
        - - all this before the American Standard Version existed. Wallace says
        &quot;The assertion that <b>te ekklesia</b> is not in the Greek New
        Testament has become entirely too prevalent among our own preachers-- it
        is an uninformed and incorrect statement...&quot; (Wallace, p. xxii).</p>
        <p>Some among us are now low-rating the KJV saying it was not the Bible
        of the Restoration movement. But Wallace challenges such to look at the
        quotes in Campbell's book <u>Christian Baptism</u> and his defense of
        the Restoration principles in the <u>Campbell-Rice Debate.</u> The
        citations were from the KJV. Furthermore, the works of Campbell's
        contemporaries show that the KJV was their Bible also. Finally, Wallace
        vigorously says &quot;The statement that the King James Version was not
        the Bible of the Restoration is a stupid statement. It reveals a spirit
        of animosity toward the Bible as we have had it and known it that is
        inexplicable.&quot; (Wallace, p. xxv).</p>

        <b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
        <p align="CENTER">VII. Conclusion</p>
        </b></font><font face="Times New Roman">
        <p>It may appear from this paper that I support and uphold the KJV and
        if &quot;it is charged that a <i>crusade</i> against the new versions is
        being conducted,...that is exactly so, but it is made necessary by the <i>fight</i>
        that is being waged against the Bible.&quot; (Wallace, p. xxxiv).</p>
        <p>George W. DeHoff in the introduction to <u>A Review of the New
        Versions</u>, says bluntly &quot;Anything which can not be proved by the
        King James and American Standard Revised Bibles is not the truth.&quot;
        (p. xv).</p>
        <p>How does Foy E. Wallace feel about the KJV in his book? He holds
        forth strongly for it, speaking of it as &quot; 'the grand old
        version'&quot; (p. xxii). He sums up his fears in the statement &quot;it
        is my firm conviction that the greatest immediate danger confronting the
        churches of Christ is the general acceptance of the pseudo-versions of
        the Bible.&quot; (p. xxxv).</p>
        <p>As to the importance of an accurate translation, Trench reminds us
        that when correctly translated what we have is &quot;not the translation
        of an inspired Book, but is itself <b>the inspired Book.&quot;</b>
        (Wallace p. 646).</p>
