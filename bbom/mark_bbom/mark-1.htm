 <pre><FONT COLOR = "BLACK"><font face="Courier New">The Gospel of Mark is a wonderful book for busy people who are
reading the Gospel for their very first time.  It presents our Lord "on
the move" serving, teaching, and working miracles.  Mark pictures
Jesus as the Miracle Working Servant of God who came not to be
ministered unto but to minister   even to the point of giving his life
for us on the cross.

     Someone has said, "The Gospel is neither a discussion nor a
debate, it is an announcement!"  And Mark wastes no time in giving
that announcement, for it is found in the opening words of his book.

     (You can notice on the Background Study Sheet how Mark's
Gospel fits in with that of Matthew, Luke and John.)</font><font face="Times New Roman">

</font>Mark 1:1-8          (The New King James Bible)<FONT COLOR = "BLACK">

1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.  
2 As it is written in the Prophets:  
 "Behold, I send My messenger before Your face,  
Who will prepare Your way before You." 
3 "The voice of one crying in the wilderness:  
 Prepare the way of the Lord;  
Make His paths straight.' " 

4 John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of
repentance for the remission of sins. 
5 Then all the land of Judea, and those from Jerusalem, went out to
him and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their
sins.  
6 Now John was clothed with camel's hair and with a leather belt
around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.  
7 And he preached, saying, "There comes One after me who is
mightier than I, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to stoop down
and loose.  
8 "I indeed baptized you with water, but He will baptize you with the
Holy Spirit.

               <font size="4" color="blue"> The Beginning of the Gospel</font>

     The word "gospel" simply means "the good news."  It was the
announcement of victories, royal visits, and wonderful special events. 
In the New Testament the "gospel of Jesus Christ" is the good news
that God's Son has come into the world and died for our sins.  It is the
good news that we can be forgiven and be made a part of God's
family and one day live with God in heaven.  It is the announcement
of victory over sin, death and hell.

       <font color = blue><font size="4">The Forerunner Identified by the Prophets   1:2-3</font>
</font color = blue>
     Mark begins with the time when the "Good News" first began to
be proclaimed by the ministry of John the Baptist.  John's work in
preparing the way for the coming of God's Son was itself a subject
former prophets wrote about (Malachi 3:1; Isaiah 40:3).

     The terms "messenger" and "voice" refer to John the Baptist as
being sent by God to prepare the way for His Son (Matthew 3; Luke
3:1-18; John 1:19-34).  In ancient times, before a king visited any part
of his realm, a messenger was sent before him to prepare the way. 
This included both repairing the roads and preparing the people.

     John prepared the way for the Lord by calling the nation to
repentance and pointing them to Jesus as the Christ, the Lamb of God,
sent to take away the sins of the world.

      <font size="4" color="blue">The Servant Identified by the Forerunner    1:4-8</font>

     Jesus called John the greatest of the prophets (Matthew 11:7-13). 
The "wilderness" where John preached was the rugged wasteland
along the western shore of the Dead Sea and the Jordan River.  His
food and dress was of the simplest fare.  He was much like Elijah (2
Kings 1:8; Malachi 4:5; Luke 1:13-17).

     John was careful to magnify Jesus and not himself.  He baptized
repentant sinners in water for the remission of sins.  John himself did
no miracles (John 10:41) but he said the One coming after him would
baptize with the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:4-5).

     <font color = blue size="4">The Servant Identified by the Father and the Spirit -
                   1:9-11</font color = blue>

     Mark tells of two witnesses who identified Jesus as the Christ to
John the Baptist.  When Jesus was baptized the Spirit came upon Him
as a dove, and the Father spoke from heaven and identified His
beloved Son.

     It doesn't seem that this identification of Jesus by the Father was
intended for the people's benefit, but for John and Jesus
 (John 1:29-34) so we're not sure if the people saw the dove or
 heard the voice from heaven.  But it assured John so he could
speak with divine authority.

           <font size="4"> </font><font size="4" color="blue">The Servant's Preparation    1:12 - 13</font>

     Mark doesn't give as full an account of the temptations as do
Matthew and Luke.  In saying that Jesus was "driven" by the spirit
into the wilderness Mark shows the intensity of the experience.  No
time was spent basking in the glory of the heavenly voice.  The
Servant had a task before Him and He prepares for it.

     Just as Moses was forty days on Mount Sinai, our Lord fasted
forty days in the wilderness and met the temptations of Satan
victoriously.

     He is then ready to begin His mission of preaching the Gospel and
training the twelve for world-wide evangelism.
