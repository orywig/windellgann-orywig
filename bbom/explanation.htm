<IMG SRC="rd_star.gif" width="21" height="18">  I had already been impressed with the advice given in Halley's Bible Handbook  on the title page, his statement  <i>"The Most Important Page in This Book Is 814"</i>*  <font size = -1>[The page number may vary is different editions.] 

<font size = 3>
 Then while I was a student in a Bible college one of my professors told about a program of preaching  that he strongly recommended.  So this program is not
</font></font>original</font> with me.<P>

<IMG SRC="rd_star.gif" width="21" height="18">The plan as I developed it called for studying from a book of the Bible for a month, usually in the mid-week Bible class, and then preaching from that book at least once on Sunday.<font color = red> 

  </font>

<UL><IMG SRC="rd_star.gif" width="21" height="18">I alternate each month between studying an Old Testament book and a New Testament book.<P>

<IMG SRC="rd_star.gif" width="21" height="18">I post a "reading sheet" and encourage everyone in the congregation to read the "Bible Book of the Month" and sign-up!  This is emphasized and encouraged so much that practically everyone in the congregation  participates.<P>

<IMG SRC="rd_star.gif" width="21" height="18">The  effect is tremendous!  The congregation is reading the book!  They are studying from it in the mid-week Bible study, and they get at least one sermon from it on the Lord's Day!<P>

<IMG SRC="rd_star.gif" width="21" height="18">I personally followed the program for many years, and have repeated many of the books.<font color = red> 

  </font>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="rd_star.gif" width="21" height="18">Details:  I study one of the gospels every six months.  I also divide a few of the books into "Parts", such as Genesis Part 1  (ch. 1-11)  and Part 2 (12-50)  and Acts Part 1 (ch. 1-12) and Part 2(ch. 13-28) and the
  <font size="3" color="black">Psalms</font> in 5 Parts according to the Book divisions.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG SRC="wp60b.gif" width = 30 height = 30 align = bottom> Some of the lessons&nbsp; posted can be viewed on screen  or you may download a zipped  WordPerfect  formatted file.  These files are the lessons sheets I use as handouts each week.  You should print them out using the print Options, Booklet Printing.  The zipped file contains the full lesson-set for the book, including the Teacher's Notes when there are any.<font color = red> <p>

</font>

  Most of the lesson sheets in the future will be posted in the<font color="#800080"> 
  Adobe Acrobat&nbsp; PDF</font> format, and you can download free the 
  <font color="#800080">Adobe Acrobat Reader</font> needed for viewing and printing these lessons.  There are many advantages to this format and it is quite popular now.  The printed sheets will be ready to serve as a 'master' for making copies for your study group.<br>
