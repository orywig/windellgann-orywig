     The basic message of the Colossians letter is the exaltation
of Jesus Christ as pre-eminent over all things and in all ways. 
Christ is the sum and substance of every verse and chapter. 
Colossians has been named the most Christ-centered epistle in
the New Testament.  Christ is related to every point and passage
in the book.

     Three great phrases in the epistle sum up this truth:
1:18  "... that in all things  ___  ________  ______  ______
____________"
2:9    "... in him  ________ all the _______ of the ______
_________"
3:11   "... Christ is ______ and _____  ________."

     The failure of the Colossians was at this very point, of "not
holding fast the Head" (2:19).
     Christ is pre-eminent in all ways;  He is the antidote to false
doctrines and he is the basis of the Christian's holy new life.
