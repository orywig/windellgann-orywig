     TEXT  Jonah 2:1-10

     2:     The Psalm of Thanksgiving
            This prayer speaks of deliverance already expressed, and 
                 is Jonah's thanks to God from not letting him drown. 

         No one could have known these personal things except the
              prophet himself.  This speaks for Jonah's authorship.

     2:10   The fish did everything on schedule as appointed.
