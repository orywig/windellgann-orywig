<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt">* TEACHERS,  Be sure to read the "Background Sheet".</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt">There is a lot of application that can be made to us today
from these Old Testament lessons.  We are not studying
just to know the "facts" of Obadiah, but to learn truths
and principles that will be useful to us today &#8211;   so
always feel free to apply these lessons and use event
which come to your mind to illustrate them.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt">The Key Lesson is about the dangers of pride and how
destructive it is.  Both nationally, and individually.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt">READ IN CLASS  Verses 1-9.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt">Lesson #1 is about the attitude that doomed Edom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt">Lesson #2 will be about the activity that doomed Edom.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt">Q-1  Our fortifications will only be good for as long as
we are a decent god-fearing nation.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt">Q-2  We are polluting our air and water.  In many places
we seem to be running out of water.  We are destroying
our forest with fires, etc, using up many natural
resources.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt">Q-3  We as the US hardly know which nations we can
count on to help us.  Probably very few!!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Individually, in time of trouble, who would come to
help us?  Family?  friends?   Members of the church?</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt">Point:  We need to trust in God!!</span></p>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt">Q-4  A nation may be a world-leader in "science" but it
can be brought down (by a surprising or unusually or
unexpected kind of war, internal strife, plague, famine,
etc.)</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt">Q-5  We can only count on God!</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt">Q-6  The lesson is that even a great and well prepared
army cannot save a nation if the Lord is determined to
bring it down.   Examples:  Gideon with 300 against the
Midianites when they numbered 180,000.   Or David and
Goliath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Numbers are nothing to God.</span></p>
