mountain people.  They lived in the desert-mountain region 
of Mt. Seir, reaching from south of the Dead Sea to the 
Gulf of Akabah.  They carved great protective fortresses in 
the rock mountains and canyons.  Their principle city was 
Sela (Hebrew), or Petra (Greek), which simply meant "The 
Rock" and was carved out of the side of the mountains.  
The rose-red, orange and yellow mountain walls made 
Petra a colorful stronghold.</span></span></p>
