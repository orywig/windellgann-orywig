lessons are abbreviated.  This small book has some very  
significant lessons for us in this 20th Century.   Petrie in  
his book <span style="text-decoration: underline">Israel's Prophets</span>, made the comment that "the  
costly and most radiant gems are often strung on the

and affairs... when we think that all of our  
accomplishments have been achieved by ourselves... when  
we become filled with <span style="text-decoration: underline">pride</span>, we need to heed the warning  
from this prophet of God.  This Prophet warned Edom that  
her <span style="text-decoration: underline">pride</span> had deceived her.</span></p>  
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The nation of Edom was a mighty little nation at this  
time.  Her capital was Petra, a Rock City hidden securely  
in the mountains.  She was a trade center for caravans cris-crossing the desert.    </span></p>  
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The prophet Obadiah has announced God's judgment  
against the nation of Edom for an unfounded pride of heart.   
She had placed her confidence for her security in "things"  
instead of in God.  But now in this paragraph of study from  
Obadiah the prophet turns from her ungodly attitude to her  
ungodly action.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>It was a terrible thing she had done to Judah and the  
deed would come back to her.  One thing we can be sure if  
that we will reap what we sow (Galatians 6:6-7).</span></p>  
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Verse 11 tells us more detail of what Edom had  
exactly done.  She had stood by in the day of Jerusalem's  
distress and watched as the enemies invaded and sacked  
the holy city.  Because she enjoyed watching what  
happened to God's people without lifting a hand to help she  
is accused as being one of them that did it.</span></p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The enemy had pillaged the city and cast lots for the  
spoils and Edom was only happy to see it happen to her  
"brother".</span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Obadiah teaches us that we cannot stand idly by  
during our neighbor's calamity.  Her hated for Judah  
silenced any voice of compassion.  Because of her own  
corruption innocent multitudes suffered.  Obadiah is a  
standing rebuke to the person who prefers not to become  
involved in the problems of others, and is an even greater  
rebuke to one who finds sadistic joy in the misfortunes of  
others.</span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>But what made it worse is that Edom and Judah came  
forth from the same womb as twins.  The Edomites were  
descendants of Esau while the people of Judah were  
descendants of Esau's twin brother, Jacob.</span></p>  
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Edom's uninvolvement soon gave way to active  
participation.  She soon crossed the street and began  
pillaging the debris.  Refugees trying to escape were  
caught by Edom and returned to the invading enemy.   
Passive indifference had given way to active alliance.</span></p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>We should learn from this book how strongly God 
denounces indifference.  Edom's heart was calloused by 
hate to Israel's needs.  But this isn't just a thing of the past.  
It happens today when we see not only people who are 
indifferent to the needs of others, but profiting from their 
distress.</span></p>
<br>

our country today, what does the governor have to do first?  
He calls out the National Guard, not to guard against 
Russia, or Cuba, not to guard against the "enemy", but to

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>A few years back the city of Mobile and south 
Alabama were devastated by hurricane Frederick.  People 
were losing all they had, fleeing for their lives, and people 
along the escape route greatly increased the motel rates and 
merchants were charging twice the price for a loaf of 
bread.</span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Is that compassion, during the time of our brother's

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>A few days later when hundreds were volunteering

advantage of the unfortunate.  Edom took advantage of
Israel.  But what about us?  Do we take advantage of
other's misfortunes?  Do we hire the poor for less because
he is downtrodden?  [Q-  Can you think of ways people
today sometimes take advantage of others in unfortunate
