<p><center>Text: Nehemiah 2:1-20</center>


<p><strong><em><center></em><H2>FROM

CUPBEARER TO LEADER</H2></CENTER>
</strong>

<p>	The main theme of the book of Nehemiah is 'Leadership.'  Supporting
this overall theme are the many subpoints that deal with qualities needed
in good leadership.

<p><strong><center><b><H2>1.	Leaders Must Be Trustworthy-- 1:11</H2></B></center></strong>

<p>We learn in 1:11 that Nehemiah was the "cupbearer" for King Artaxerxes. 
He was perhaps the most trusted man in the king's service.  It was his
responsibly to see to the food and drink of the king.  He had to be a man
the king trusted would not poison him.  (I Timothy 3:7).

<p><strong><center><b><H2>2.	Leaders Must Forget Self-- 2:1-4</H2></B></center></strong>

<p>	After the visit by the Jerusalem delegation Nehemiah prayed for four
months about the condition of things in Jerusalem.  During this time he
mourned and fasted.  His countenance was not the same perfection of
pleasantness as before.  It was vital to be happy in the presence of the
Persian king lest he think you were displeased with him and plotting
against him.  But Nehemiah forgot himself and appeared before the king
with a sad countenance.  Leaders must be willing to take their task to
heart and forget self.  (Matthew 16:24, Titus 1:7).

<p>	The king inquired whether Nehemiah had a request of him.  And
quickly, and silently, Nehemiah utters another short prayer to God.  Then
he told Artaxerxes of the reproachful condition of the city of his ancestors.

<p><strong><center><b><H2>3. Leaders Must Be Planners-- 2:5-8</H2></B></center></strong>

<p>	When we see the extent of Nehemiah's reply to the king's inquiry it
becomes evident that he had been meditating about what it would take to
get matters off dead center.  He has been thinking about all that it would
require it get the construction project done.  Read verse 5-8 see the details

<p>he had worked out.

<P> When the king asked him how long he would be gone Nehemiah "set
him a time."  His plans were so definite that he had a time-table in mind. 
Goals (projects) should have a time-limit for their accomplishments.

<p>	Preparations were made to secure all the necessary supplies for the
project.  He had letters that would allow him to obtain the timbers and
beams for the gates needed for the wall, the castle, and the temple, etc.

<p>	If one is ever looking for evidence that prayer changes things, notice
how it prepared the heart of the king for Nehemiah's work,  <em>"And the king
granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</em>"

<p><strong><center><b><H2>4.	Leaders Wisely Survey the Situation -- 2:9-16</H2></B></center></strong>

<p>	Nehemiah came to Jerusalem and waited three days.  This suspense
must have nearly killed the people and the opposition.  What in the world
was Nehemiah up to?!  A man of this importance, escorted by officers and
calvary of the king's army, coming to seek the welfare of the Jews brought
sadness to their enemies.

<p>	In the darkness of night Nehemiah and only a few men surveyed the
condition of the broken wall and burned gates.  As yet he had told no one
his purpose for coming.  Nehemiah did not needlessly and prematurely
arouse opposition. 

<p>	A wise physician always makes a thorough diagnosis of his patient 
before he prescribes.  Industrialists survey a town and all the necessary
circumstances before locating a plant in a community.  In like manner
leaders must take stock of the current situation as Paul did (1 Cor.7:26).

<p>	That night Nehemiah must have been calculating what size of a labor
force would be required, what materials would be needed, how much
rubbish would have to be moved, and how to go about accomplishing the
task that would bless the Lord's people.

<p><strong><center><b><H2>5. 	Leaders Appeal For Helpers-- 2:17-18</H2></B></center></strong>

<p>	Leaders realize they cannot do the job by themselves.  Those who try
to do everything will fail and do the Lord and the Lord's people a
mis-service.  "It is better to lead ten in working than to try do the work of
ten men."

<p>	Even the apostles couldn't do it all!  In Acts 6 they needed help and
called upon the church for workers.  Husbands need their wives and
families.  The boss needs his faithful employees.  Life is a team effort.

<p><strong><center><b><H2>6.	 Leaders Must Be Motivators-- 2:17-18, 20</H2></B></center></strong>

<p>	Nehemiah had done all his homework, made his inspections and it was
now time to discuss the matter with the people.  He would need to inspire
them, or motivate them.  As we look at the details of his procedure leaders
today can learn some valuable lessons about motivation.

<p><strong>	a.  Leaders must share information</strong>.  Nehemiah called the people
together and informed them why he had come to Jerusalem.  People must
have an understanding about a cause or work to become motivated over it.

<p><strong>	b.  The people must see the need.</strong>  Nehemiah pointed out <em>"how
Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire"</em> and
stressed that the building of the wall was important so <em>"that we be no
more a reproach."</em> (v.17)

<p><strong>	c.  The goal was made clear. </strong> The people knew clearly what they
were working to accomplish.  When the goals are fuzzy no one is
motivated!  It must become "my" goal, we don't get excited about the other
people's goals.

<p><strong>	d.  Success was visualized.</strong>  The people were able to see what it
would mean to them to have the walls around their city again (v.20a). 
The steps necessary to accomplish the goal must be laid out, and each step
realistically attainable.  In Nehemiah's call <em>"Let us rise up and build" </em>he
probably outlined what needed to be done first, second, and third.  And
they proceeded orderly; removing the rubbish, building the wall, setting
the gates.

<p><strong>	e.  There must be enthusiasm for the goal.</strong>  We can see and hear the
enthusiasm in Nehemiah's voice as he speaks what must have become a
rally slogan "<em>...come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem"</em> (v.17) 
and  the people mirror his enthusiasm as they echo back <em>"Let us rise up
and build!"</em> (v.18).

<p><strong><center><b><H2>7.	Leaders Must Identify With the People-- 2:17-18</H2></B></center></strong>

<p>	Nehemiah did not think of this project as "his" work, nor was it a
project he expect "them" to do.  But he identified himself with them in
building, "<em>let us..."</em>

<p>	As we shall later see Nehemiah was out there on the wall with them
supervising the work.  He didn't "send" them to the work, but he went with
them.

<p><strong><center><b><H2>8.	Leaders Must Be Able to Handle Criticism--  2:19-20</H2></B></center></strong>

<p>	Sanballat, Tobiah and Geshem <em>"laughed us to scorn, and despised
us..."</em> said Nehemiah.  The KJV word here for "mock" is a word meaning
"to utter repeatedly words of derision."  The enemy sneered at Nehemiah
saying "You're out of your mind.  You'll never be able to do that!"

<p>	Nehemiah encourages us to not be defeated by opposition.  Expect
opposition, but don't let it defeat you!  [Scripture]  Teachers must teach
what is true, right, and needful and not become discouraged by criticism.

<p><strong><center><b><H2>9.	Leaders Take God Into Their Plans--   2:20</H2></B></center></strong>

<p>	The way for leaders to not let opposition discourage them is to put
their trust in the Lord and not in themselves.  If it is "my" work, I might
fail, but if it is the work of God, nothing can stop it if we will be faithful
to it!  (Acts 6:38-39).
