<p><strong><center>INTRODUCTION</strong></center>


<p>	A  former governor in the course of a nominating speech before a political
convention, paid an eloquent tribute to his candidate in these words:  "It is
my honor to nominate a man for your governor, who, when he was a little
boy, always hoed to the end of the row."  Nehemiah was a great man because
he did what he set out to do; he did not stop until the walls of Jerusalem were
rebuilt (6:15).

<p>	Nehemiah was not just concerned about "walls", but about God's people
and their protection.  He shows us that <strong>leaders</strong> are concerned about the
spiritual growth and knowledge of the people in the Word of God.

<p>	We have already been introduced to Ezra.  He was a "ready" priest and
scribe before the Lord, a skilled teacher who returned to Jerusalem with
Levite-teachers to "Rebuild the People."  Here in the heart of the book of
Nehemiah we run into him again, and as typical, he is teaching God's Word. 
We see how his work and that of Nehemiah's went hand in hand toward
"restoring" God's people to the way of life God had given them.  In face,
many Bible scholars refer to this period of Bible history as "The Restoration
Period." 

<p><strong><font color = "red">1.	The First Daily Vacation Bible School -- 8:1-18</font color = "red"></strong>

<p>	On the first day of the seventh month (September) the people gathered in
the open court before the Water Gate and asked Ezra to bring out to them the
Word of God.

<p>	Picture in your mind, nearly all Israel congregating on the Feast Day of
the Trumpets, and Ezra standing on a platform facing west from early
morning till mid-day reading the Scriptures to the people and explaining it so
they could understand it fully.  Whether this meant he read it from the
Hebrew and translated it into the Aramaic dialect which they used since the
captivity, or whether he paused in the reading and "commented" and
"explained" it, we're not sure.  But the ASV says "And they read in the book,
in the law of God, distinctly: and they gave the sense, so that they understood
the reading."

<p>	a)  <u><strong>We notice their attention</strong></u>.  The assembly was composed of both
"men and the women, and of those [children] that could understand." They
listened attentively all morning as Ezra and others helped him with the
reading and teaching.

<p>	b)  <strong><u>We notice their reverence</strong></u>.  When "Ezra opened the book in the sight
of all the people...all the people stood up."  In our mind we can see the
reverent assembly rising to its feet in quiet reverence as God's Book is
opened.

<p>	c)  <u><strong>We notice the preparation</strong></u>.  Apparently a platform had been built for
this occasion  so all the people could see and hear Ezra.  It is appropriate to
arrange the setting so God's Word can best be heard and taught.

<p>	d)  <u><strong>We notice the participation</strong></u>.  When Ezra praised God the people all
the people answered "Amen, Amen!"

<p>	e)  <u><strong>We notice the emotional experience</strong></u>.  The people's response to the
reading of the Scriptures and to Ezra's praises must have been an emotional
experience for everyone present.  Lifting their hands toward heaven they
shouted "Amen!  Amen!"  in an expression of agreement with God's Word. 
Then they fell on their knees and bowed low as they worshipped the Lord 
(v.6).

<p><strong><font color = "red">2.	Response to the study of  God's Word -- 8:1-18</font color = "red"></strong>

<p>	The sequence in chapter 8 is striking-- we see:

<p>	a)  <u><strong>An intellectual response</strong></u>  (v.1-8).  The people were able to
understand distinctly the word of the Lord and cried out in agreement to it.

<p>	b)  <u><strong>An emotional response</strong></u>  (v.9-12).  As the people heard the Word they
wept (v.9).  Apparently they were remorseful over their past disobedience to
the Law and contrite over their sins.  Nehemiah, Ezra, and the Levites who
helped with the teaching consoled the people and assured them this was not
the time for weeping but the time for rejoicing.

<p>	c)  <u><strong>An obedient response</strong></u>  (v.13-18).  Encouraged to give themselves to
the keeping of the holy day the way it was intended they responded with
gladness and feasting and giving of gifts to the poor.

<p>	On the second day when they gathered and gave attention to the reading
of the Scriptures they read how Moses gave instructions for the keeping of
the Feast of Tabernacles.  This was one of the happiest celebrations of the
Jews.  It involved the building of rough temporary shelters out of branches
and leafs on their house tops or in the open courts by the gates (v.16).  This
reminded them how their ancestors had lived wandering in the wilderness. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	It must have been great fun for the children, for it was like a  "camp out" 
and a time for good eating  (v.12)  and happiness.   A time of family
togetherness,  a  "family retreat,"  Thanksgiving and Christmas rolled into
one. 

<p>		"And all the assembly of them that were come again out of the
captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths...  And there was
very great gladness.  Also day by day, from the first day unto the
last, he read in the book of the law of God.  And they kept the
feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly,
according unto the ordinance" (8:17-18, ASV).

<p><strong><font color = "red">3.	Their Covenant Renewed With God --</font color = "red"> 9:1-4, 38: 10:1, 28-32</strong>

<p>	God's Word had a tremendous impact on the community.  It pointed the
people to their sin (8:9), led them to worship God  (8:12, 14), and gave them
great joy (8:17).

<p>	a)	<u><strong>They confessed their sins</strong></u> -- 9:1-4.  Fasting and wearing sackcloth
with dirt on their heads they come before God and for three hours they read
the Law.  Then for another three hours they confessed their sins and
worshipped the Lord.

<p>		Its so proper that in this book of Nehemiah, which has more reference
to prayer and its place in the life of God's people,  that we should also have
the longest prayer in the Bible.  In chapter 9 verses 5 - 38 we have the prayer
of repentance and confession on the part of the people.

<p>	b)  <u><strong>They promise to obey</u> </strong>-- 9:38- 10:1, 28-32.  The people not only
resolved to repent and follow God but they committed their goals to writing
and signed it.  This served to remind them of the determination they had
when they renewed their covenant with God.  There is probably nothing as
powerful in motivating one to keep his mind on his goal as putting it into
writing and signing it.

<p>		(1)	It commits us because we clearly see our goal.

<p>		(2)	It prompts us to  strive  for the goal because others are aware of
our commitments.  It is public.  See what Jesus says about public
commitment in Matt 10:32,33. 

<p>	The civil and religious leaders led the way signing to keep God's Word. 
The list begins with Nehemiah, who again set an excellent example for the
people as their leader.

<p>	c)	 <strong><u>Cleaning Up Their Lives</u> </strong>-- 10:28-32.  Among the specific reforms
they realize they need to make is:

<p>		(1)	To separate themselves from intermarriage with the people of the
land (vs.28-31).  And that they would not give their sons and daughters to
marry the heathens in the land.  [Fathers and mothers today should strive and
pray that our children will make wise choices for mates who will help them
to be faithful in their service to God.]

<p><img src="neh05img.gif" width="416" height="316" align="middle" ><P>
		(2)	To pledge their support for the temple-- (v.32f) They would not
let the temple fall into disrepair again by pledging to give one-third a shekel
a year for its upkeep. Notice they pledged (or purposed -- 2 Cor. 9:7) to do
this. This practice was still being kept in Jesus' day though inflation had
raised it to a half-shekel (Matt.17:24-27).<center>
