                BACKGROUND:  

       The second letter to Timothy was written from the Mamertine Prison in Rome. 

     Paul writes his most personal letter, and we see more of his thoughts and feelings.

       In this letter Paul refers to Timothy twice as his &quot;son,&quot; just as in the introduction

     in 1 Timothy he called him &quot;my son in the faith.&quot;  Paul urges Timothy to endure

     hardness as a &quot;good soldier&quot; of Jesus Christ.  He exhorts him to &quot;hold fast&quot; to sound

     words he has heard from Paul and warns him of a coming apostasy or &quot;departure&quot; from

     the faith (ch. 3).

       This is Paul's last writing.  He was facing death-- martyrdom.  He had to say much

     in a little time.  Some of the great verses of the Bible are in this Book.

                       

             The Central Message

       &quot;I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep

            that which I have committed [deposited] unto Him against that day&quot;  (1:12).

       &quot;Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to

            be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.&quot; (2 Timothy 2:15)

     

          The Structure of the Book

       1. Paul the PREACHER --  Chapter 1

       2. Paul the EXAMPLE -- Chapter 2

       3. Paul the PROPHET -- Chapter 3

       4. Paul the PRISONER --  Chapter 4

     

        Paul the Preacher -- Chapter 1

     1.   &#07;    Paul's son in the Gospel was Timothy -- v.2

       &#07;  Paul prayed for him day and night -- v.3

       &#07;  Paul longed to see Timothy -- v. 4

       &#07;  He had full confidence in Timothy -- v.5

       &#07;  He told him to stir up his gift -- v.6

       &#07;  Timothy is not to be ashamed of the message or messengers of Christ -- v.8

       &#07;  He reminds Timothy of his calling -- v.9

       &#07;  Timothy is to hold to sound doctrine -- v.13

       &#07;  Timothy is to remain true to the ministry -- v.14

     

     2.   Note some things Paul says about himself.

          &#07;    an apostle -- v. 1 and 11

          &#07;    a preacher -- v. 11

          &#07;    a teacher --  v. 11

          &#07;    then in v.12 he rings out what every Christian should remember.  Paul

                    says -- &quot;I am not ashamed -- for I know --  I have committed.&quot;

     

     3.   The final verses of ch.1 reveal that Paul has been forsaken by so-called friends. 

               He had been helped by one-- Onesiphorus.

     

        Paul the Example -- Chapter 2

       In this chapter Paul uses seven figures of speech to describe the duty and activity

     of a disciple of the Lord.

     1.   A SON--he should follow the example and teach others, so they may teach

                 others-- v.1-2.

     2.   A SOLDIER -- he is to &quot;endure hardness&quot; or hardships  and avoid the en-

                 tanglements of the world--to please the One who made him a soldier-- v.3-4.

     3.   AN ATHLETE-- he is to contend for the reward.  He is to abide by the rules-- v.5

     4.   A FARMER--  must labor before he partakes of the fruit --v.6

     5.   A STUDENT-- must &quot;rightly divide&quot; the Word of God --v.15  

     6.   A VESSEL-- a vessel must be clean to be usable-- v.20-21

     7.   A SERVANT-- a disciple is a servant, gentle, apt to teach, patient -- v.24.

     

        Paul the Prophet -- Chapter 3

       In chapter 3 Paul speaks of &quot;perilous times&quot; that were coming to the church.  The

     &quot;last days&quot; is often misunderstood to mean the &quot;last days&quot; of the Christian age, but in

     all other passages it refers to the &quot;last days&quot; of the Jewish system which came to its end

     in AD 70 with the destruction of the temple.

       In verses 2-13 Paul uses 22 words or phrases to describe the &quot;perilous times&quot; that

     were coming upon the church.  The church has had to contend with such problems

     ever since.

     1.   &quot;lovers of their own selves&quot;

     2.   &quot;covetous&quot; -- get what one wants

     3.   &quot;boasters&quot; -- braggart

     4.   &quot;proud&quot; -- haughty

     5.   &quot;blasphemers&quot; -- denying Christ, using God's name in vain

     6.   &quot;disobedient&quot;

     7.   &quot;unthankful&quot;

     8.   &quot;unholy&quot; -- profane

     9.   &quot;without natural affection&quot;

     10.  &quot;truce-breakers&quot; -- promises mean nothing

     11.  &quot;false accusers&quot;

     12.  &quot;Incontinent&quot; -- without self-control

     13.  &quot;fierce&quot; -- is savage

     14.  &quot;despisers of those that are good&quot;

     15.  &quot;traitors&quot; -- or betrayers

     16.  &quot;heady&quot; -- reckless

     17.  &quot;high-minded&quot; -- drunk with pride

     18.  &quot;lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God&quot;

     19.  &quot;have a form&quot; -- hypocritical

     20.  &quot;ever learning&quot;  -- never able to discern truth

     21.  &quot;seducers&quot; -- sorcerers, beguilers

     22.  &quot;deceiving and being deceived&quot;

       In verse 14-17 we learn that the source of help and truth is the Word of God. 

     Paul says &quot;But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and been assured

     of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them&quot; etc. v. 14.

     

     

        Paul the Prisoner -- Chapter 4

     1.   His Final Charge--  Vs. 1, 2, 5

       &#07;  &quot;at His appearing&quot; -- the Lord's Second coming and the judgment of all men

               dead and alive

       &#07;  &quot;preach the Word&quot; --  not substitutes

       &#07;  &quot;be diligent all the time&quot;

       &#07;  &quot;reprove, rebuke, exhort&quot;

       &#07;  &quot;watch thou (be alert) in all things&quot;

       &#07;  &quot;endure afflictions&quot;

       &#07;  &quot;do the work of an evangelist&quot;

       &#07;  &quot;make full proof of the ministry&quot;

     2.   His Final Warning--  Vs. 3-4

       &#07;  Time will come when men will not listen to doctrine

       &#07;  Men will try to satisfy their own lusts

       &#07;  They will find false teachers that please them

       &#07;  They will turn away from truth-- believe fables

     3.   His Final Testimony -- Vs. 6-8

       &#07;  &quot;(6) For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at

               hand. (7)  I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept

               the faith: (8)  Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,

               which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me

               only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.&quot;  (2 Timothy 4:6-8)

       &#07;  This is Paul's farewell statement in the Bible.  It came from him in prison at

               Rome and it appears that he was waiting for his death sentence to be carried

               out.

     4.   His Last Words --  Vs. 9-22

       &#07;  Timothy was to try to come see him -- v.9

       &#07;  &quot;Demas&quot;  (Demetrius) deserted v. 10

       &#07;  Only Luke was with Paul.  Requested Mark to come -- v.11

       &#07;  Tychicus had been sent to Ephesus  --v.12

       &#07;  Requested Timothy to bring his coat to keep him warm and the books and

                 especially the &quot;parchments&quot;

       &#07;  Alexander had persecuted him -- v.14-15 (Acts 19&quot;33)

          &quot;At my first answer&quot; (his first hearing) &quot;the Lord stood with me... that all

               Gentiles might hear&quot; -- v. 16-17 (We believe this took place in Nero's

               palace.  He stood alone-- only the Lord stood with him and he preached the

               Gospel.)

                      &#07;  The last few verses are personal greetings and Paul's final benediction.&#12;             Wise Unto Salvation

       &quot;And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to

            make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.&quot; (2 Timothy

            3:15)

     

     I.   The Need For Knowing The Scriptures

       1. The Scriptures are inspired of God and profitable for doctrine, reproof,

               correction, and instruction in righteousness  (2 Tim. 3:16).

       2. The Scriptures throughly furnish one unto all good works, 2 Tim. 3:17.

       3. Paul expressed in 2:15 the need for &quot;rightly dividing&quot; the Word of Truth.

       4. The Scriptures teach us God's plan of redemption.  What is revealed in God's

               plan will make us ....

     II.  Wise Unto Salvation

       A. FAITH--  stands between the sinner and salvation.

          1.   Redemption requires one to come to Christ in faith that He is the Son

                    of God, the promised Savior and Redeemer  (John 8:24, Luke 2:11;

                    Mark 16:16)

          2.   This faith comes by the process of hearing the gospel and being

                    convinced of the truth to the extend one will commit himself to obey the

                    faith (Rom. 10:17; 16:26; Heb. 5:9; Matt. 7:21).

       B. REPENTANCE-- stands between the sinner and salvation.

          1.   God expects men to turn away from a sinful course of life and live holy

                    before him  (Luke 13:3; 2 Cor. 6:17).

          2.   Men must repent in obedience to the Lord (Acts 2:38).

       C. CONFESSION--  stands between the sinner and salvation.

          1.   One must confess his faith in Jesus as Christ, Savior, and Lord  (Rom.

                    10:9,10; Matt. 10:32; Phil. 2:11)

       D. BAPTISM-- stands between the sinner and salvation.

          1.   Baptism is a &quot;form&quot; of the death, burial and resurrection of Christ

                    (Rom. 6:14, 3-5).

          2.   In baptism one's state or condition is changed from being &quot;out&quot; of

                    Christ to being &quot;in&quot; Him (Gal. 3:27; Col. 1:13-14).

          3.   In baptism one's relation to sin is changed.  Before baptism one is

                    pictured as lost in sins (Acts 22:16) but after baptism one is pictured as

                    &quot;being then made free from sin&quot; (Rom. 6:17-18).

          4.   One's sins are washed or cleansed by the blood of Christ (Rev. 1:5). 

                    Just as the Lord shed his blood in death when we are baptized in the

                    &quot;likeness&quot; of his death our sins are washed away (Rom. 6:3-5; Acts

                    22:16).

       D. A FAITHFUL LIFE -- stands between the Christian and salvation.

          1.   When one is baptized as described in Acts 2:38 the Lord adds him to

                    the church (Acts 2:47).  There is only one church and that is the one to

                    which the Lord adds obedient believers (Eph. 4:4).

       Conclusion:

          1.   Let us resolve to follow  God's Word.
