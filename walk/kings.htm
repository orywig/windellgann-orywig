              INTRODUCTION
          
               First and Second Kings are just a continuation of the Books of
          Samuel.  As their name suggests, they record the events of the reign
          of Solomon and then the succeeding kings of Judah and Israel.  In the
          Hebrew Bible 1st and 2nd Samuel form one book, 1st and 2nd Kings
          form a second, and 1st and 2nd Chronicles form a third book.

          Structure of First Kings:

          I.   The Forty-Year Reign of King Solomon Ch. 1-11

               1.   Solomon was the last king to reign over a united Hebrew
                              kingdom.  He was but a young man (3:7) when he became
                              king.
               2.   Solomon prayed for wisdom and received it 3
               3.   Builds temple of the Lord and dedicates its4-9
               4.   Receives royal visitors and increases wealth10
               5.   Solomon's wives turn him from the Lord11
          
          II.  The First Eighty Years of Two Kingdoms Ch. 12-22

               1.   Immediately after the death of Solomon the division of the
                              kingdom takes place and ten tribes in the north (referred to as
                              ISRAEL are led by Jeroboam-- and two tribes in the south,
                              JUDAH, remain loyal to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon.

               2.   The sins of Israel (12:24-33).  Jeroboam built false centers of
                              worship at Dan and Bethel to keep the people from going to
                              Jerusalem to worship--and he made &quot;priests of the lowest
                              people, not of the sons of Levi.&quot;

               3.   There are two lines of Kings and during this 80-year period of
                              1st Kings Judah had four and Israel eight.  All eight of Israel
                              were evil. Two of Judah's kings (Asa and Jehoshaphat) were
                              good kings and reign 66 of the 80 yrs.

               4.   Elijah and some of the events of his life Ch. 17-22
                 a. Fed by ravens and widow of Zarephath 	17
                 b. Challenges Baal prophets on Mt. Carmel 	18
                 c. Flees for life from Jezebel	19
                 d. Anoints Elisha to be prophet in his place	20
                 e. Rebukes Ahab for taking Naboth's vineyard	21
          
          Archaeological discoveries confirm the contents of 1st Kings. The
          invasion of Judah by Shishak in Rehoboam's reign (I Kings 14:25) is
          proved by the inscription of Karnak.  The strongholds of Solomon in
          Megiddo, Hazor, and Gezer (I Kings 9:15-19) have been discovered. 
          Omri, king of Israel (I Kings 16:21-28) is mentioned on the Moabite
          Stone in 850 BC, and King Jehu is pictured on the Black Obelisk.

               Second Kings has been said to be &quot;Hebrew history from the
          prophetic standpoint.&quot;  In the period we meet such great prophets as
          Elijah, Elisha, Isaiah and Jeremiah who were &quot;faithfully testifying of the
          moral foundation of the nation, vindicating the righteousness of God and
          rebuking sin and upholding the divine ideal to which God's people as a
          nation had been called.&quot;
          
          Date:  The history of 2nd Kings covers approximately 265 years. We see
          the kingdom of Israel coming to an end when its capital, Samaria, was
          destroyed by the Assyrians in 722 BC after lasting 250 years (2 Kings
          17).  The kingdom of Judah lasted nearly 150 years after Israel came to
          an end when Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem in 586 BC (2 Kings
          25).
          
          Structure of Second Kings:

          I.   Elisha the prophet and his work2 Kings 	1:1 - 13:21
               1.   Associated with Elijah in his last days	1:1-2:12
               2.   Performed many miracles in Israel		2:12-13:21

          II.  Alternating history and kings of the two nations described

               1.   The downfall of Israel (God gave reasons why in ch. 17)
                 a. Sinned against the Lord their God	17:7
                 b. Walked in the statutes of the heathen	17:8
                 c. &quot;Did secretly those things that were not right against the
                              Lord their God&quot;	17:9
                 d. Set up images, idols and high places	17:10-12
                 e. Rejected the warning of the prophets 	17:13-14
                 f. Rejected statues and left commandments of God	17:15-16
                 g. Offered their children as burnt offerings	17:17
                 The nation Israel was carried into Assyrian captivity.

               2.   The downfall of Judah (Some Reasons why listed)
                 a. Did more evil than the heathen nations about them (2
                              Kings 21:9, 11, 15)
                 b. Manasseh shed innocent blood in Jerusalem (21:16)
                 The nation of Judah was carried in Babylonian captivity.

          1.   David's advice to his son Solomon is good advice for every father to
                         give his son, (2:1-3.)
          2.   Solomon prayed for wisdom just as we may, (3:5) James 1:5-7.
          3.   Solomon's apostasy stands as a warning today against marrying
                         someone who does not have the same regards for God as we do,
                         (11:4; 21:25).
          4.   Jeroboam introduces convenient religion to Israel and it has been
                         with us ever since (12:28).
          5.   A warning against being deceived under the guise of religion is
                         gained from the experience of the young prophet (13:18).
          6.   God's people must be completely on his side as the contest at Mt.
                         Carmel shows, (18:17-21).
          7.   Children usually follow the example of their parents as Ahaziah
                         followed Ahab and Jezebel, (22:51-53).

          1.   The essentially of doing what God says do is illustrated by Naaman,
                         (5:1-14).
          2.   Our responsibility and opportunity is like that of the four lepers who
                         had good tidings that needed to be told, (7:1-9).
          3.   It is dangerous to trust in &quot;bruised reeds,&quot; (18:21).
               a. Power, money, &quot;doctrines of men&quot;, etc.
          4.   &quot;What have they seen in thine house?&quot; (20:15).
          5.   Second Kings is valuable in teaching great moral lessons as backed
                         up an illustrated in history.

                                  2 Kings 5:1-14

          Introduction

          1.   Naaman was &quot;a captain,&quot; &quot;a great man,&quot; &quot;honorable,&quot; &quot;BUT he
                         was a leper.&quot;
          
          I. SOME THINGS ABOUT LEPROSY

               1. It was a loathsome disease. (A description)

               2.   It was a contagious disease. 

               3.   It was a deceptive disease.

               4.   It was a disease not inherited, but acquired.

               5.   It was a disease that had a tendency to increase.

               6.   It was a disease incurable except by the power of God.

          
          II. AN ANALOGY BETWEEN LEPROSY AND SIN

               1.   It is loathsome (Ezek. 18:20)

               2.   Sin is contagious (1 Cor. 5:6; 15:33)

               3.   Sin is deceptive (Hebrews 3:12-13)

               4.   Sin is not inherited, but acquired (Ezek. 18:20; 28:15)

               5.   Sin has a tendency to increase (James 1:15)

               6.   Sin in incurable except by the power of God.
                 (Heb. 9:22; John 14:6; Acts 4:12; 2Tim 2:10)
          
          III.  NAAMAN WAS KEPT FROM BEING CLEANSED AT FIRST:

               1.   Because he got mad (2Ki 5:11-12)
               2.   Because he had pride (2Ki 5:13)
               3.   Because he was prejudice (2Ki 5:11)
               4.   Because he wanted something sensational to happen (2ki
                              5:11, 13)
               5.   Because of the Jordan (2Kings 5:12)
          
          IV.  NAAMAN HUMBLED HIMSELF TO OBEY

               1.   2Kings 5:12
          
          Conclusion:

               1.   What was the secret of Naaman's obedience?
               2.   The same thing must be true of sinners today.
               3.   Will you manifest the same kind of faith as Naaman had?
                 Enough to take God at His word?  Enough to obey God?
