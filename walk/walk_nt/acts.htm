        <CENTER><H3>Introduction</H3></CENTER>

        <H4>
        <B>AUTHOR: </B> Acts is indeed a continuation of Luke's Gospel.  We could well refer to
the Gospel as Volume One and Acts as Volume Two.  In <a
href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?Acts+1:1">Acts 1:1</a> "the former
treatise" addressed to Theophilus (<a
href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?Luke+1:3">Luke 1:3</a>) is a reference
back to Luke's Gospel.<P>


        Internal evidence, particularly the "we" passages of Acts (16:10-17; 20:5-21; 18;
27:1-28:16) confirm Luke as the author.  Luke by profession was a physician.  He is the only
gentile author in the New Testament.  He was an eyewitness to many of the events in the book
and was Paul's co-worker. <P>
<HR>


        <B>BACKGROUND:</B>  The book of Acts begins where the gospel left off at the
resurrection and ascension of Jesus into heaven.  It takes up the story there and shows the
establishment of the Kingdom (the church) and its growth.  It is often called "the book of
conversions" because it shows how people in the first century became Christians.<P>


        <CENTER>Various titles given the book include: </CENTER>

        <B>CHARACTER:</B>  The book is historical and written in narrative form.  The history
of the Bible is HIS STORY and the pivot point of the Bible around which all things revolve is the
Cross.<BR>

is a very important book in the New Testament.  From the book we glean much background
material for the epistles.  We see the important theme of early preaching (the resurrection),
fulfillment of prophecy and a number of miracles.
</td></tr>
<td>    <B>DESIGN: </B> The book shows the progress of Christianity from Jerusalem to all
Judea, and Samaria and to the ends of the earth.  The commission of the risen Lord had already
been reported by Luke (<a
href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?Luke+24:46-49">Luke 24:46-49</a>) and
here is the description or how it was accomplished.

<LI> The key verse of the book is <a
href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?Acts+1:8">Acts 1:8</a>.  This verse is
actually like Luke's Table of Contents, or outline for the book.<BR>



<li>    The book was probably composed in about AD 61/62.  It begins with the history of AD
29/30, the year of our Lord's death, and ends following two years of Paul's imprisonment at Rome
about AD 62.<P>

In almost every audience listening to the gospel there are people with all kinds of attitudes toward
the gospel.  This is also the way it was in the first century when the apostles preached.<P>
  

<B>I. </B>We can see this is true from looking at some of the audiences of the Gospel in the
book of Acts.<P>


<OL TYPE=1>
<li> FELIX --  <a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?Acts+24:24-25">Acts
24:24-25</a>  -- Notice his response.  Indifferent - a spiritual deficiency on the hearer's part.<P>

        <li>STEPHEN'S AUDIENCE -- <a
href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?Acts+7:51-60">Acts 7:51-60</a>  -- 
Response -- rebellious. Stephen laid bare their sins-- sinners not ready to repent did not like it then
and people do not like it today.  <a

sincere man.<P>

<B>II.</B> In <a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?Acts+10:33">Acts
10:33</a> we have the setting for what might be called the Ideal Audience.  The story of
Cornelius is related to us in the passage.  God is willing to bless us as he was Cornelius if we
respond the same say.  Note elements of the response: <P>

<OL TYPE=1>
        <li> "ALL HERE" -- Not only Cornelius there, but he had invited his family and friends to
meet with him to hear words of Life from Peter.  <a
href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?Mat+11:28">Mat 11:28</a>.  No discord
among them, united in their purpose (10:24)<P>

        <li> "PRESENT" -- Notice the "promptness" they were on time. <a
href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?Rom+10:13-17">Rom 10:13-17</a>.<P>

        <li> "IN SIGHT OF GOD" -- It was a "devotional" or "reverent" audience, they realized
they were gathered "before God" and that helped them to be serious.  <a
href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?Rom+2:16">Rom 2:16</a><P>

        <li> "TO HEAR" -- There were attentive audience.<P>

        <li> "ALL THINGS"  -- They were an "unprejudiced" audience, they want to hear "all"
things, not just what tickled their ears.  <a
href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?Mat+6:19-24;+Acts+20:27">Mat 6:19-24;
Acts 20:27</a>.<P>

        <li> "COMMANDED OF GOD"  -- Yet they were a "discriminating" audience, for they
were not interested in Peter's opinions, but God's commandments.  <a
href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?Deut+18:15;+Mat+17:5">Deut 18:15; Mat
17:5</a>.
</OL><P>

Conclusion<BR>

1. Both the preacher and audience was ready for the service.<BR>

2. Sincere people responded and obeyed the gospel and became a part of the Lord's church.<P>
