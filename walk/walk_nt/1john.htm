          either the author or the recipients.  The Epistle to the Hebrews is the only other

          book similar in this respect.

          

               From the beginning it has been recognized as a letter from the Apostle

          John circulated to the churches around Ephesus (Asia Minor).

               The Apostle John worked with the church in Jerusalem until about A.D.

          70.  After the destruction of Jerusalem he made his residence at Ephesus.  He

          lived to a great age and here wrote the fourth Gospel, his three epistles and the

          Book of Revelation.

               Much information about John and testimony to his work and authorship

          has come down to us through three of his pupils, Polycarp, Papias, and

          Ignatius, who became leaders in the churches at Smyrna, Hierapolis, and

          Antioch.

          is very great.  Only much later did someone try to suggest that the &quot;elder John&quot;

          was a John different from the Apostle.  The term &quot;elder&quot; however was used by

          2nd and 3rd generation Christians to refer to their predecessors, &quot;the men of

          early days&quot;.  It was natural then for John, the last of the apostles, to refer to

          himself as one of &quot;the elder men&quot; (Cf. EGT, V, p.160).

          of an old man writing to a younger generation.  The internal relation of the

          three epistles strongly favor their time-order as we have them, 1st, 2nd, and

          3rd.  We may date them about A.D. 80-95.

color="#000000" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b>  Some false teachers were attempting to led some away from the

          truth.  John in a polite way does not name them but he leaves no doubt about

          whom he is speaking.  His language and arguments are directed to refute their

          heresy.

          

               One term used to describe this radical philosophy was Docetism.  It is

          from the Greek word that means to seem, ad the Docetists taught that Jesus

          only &quot;seemed&quot; to have a body.  They insisted that he was only a phantom and

          never had flesh and blood, physical, human body; that he was a purely spiritual

          being who only appeared to have a body.

          

               Another term used to describe a philosophy adopted and adapted by some

          false-Christian teachers was Gnosticism.  This Gnosticism led to about three

          different attitudes:

          

          1.   Since it regarded the body as evil, it sometimes took the form of

                         asceticism with fasting, celibacy, rigid control  and evil deliberate ill

                         treatment of the body.

          2.   Or--it might take the form that the body did not matter, therefore it

                         appetites and lusts might be gratified without control and without limit.

          3.   The Gnostic regarded himself as an altogether spiritual man; he was

                         above all the material things of life, so completely did they consider

                         themselves above sins that sin, for them, had ceased to exist.  To them

                         John speaks of deceiving themselves, 1:8-10.

          

          A personal enemy of John at Ephesus was a man named Cerinthus.  It might

          help us by seeing by Irenaeus says of him.

               &quot;Cerinthus, again, a man who was educated in the wisdom of the

          Egyptians,...represented Jesus as having not been born of a virgin, but as being

          the son of Joseph and Mary according to the ordinary course of human

          generation, while he nevertheless was more righteous, prudent, and wise than

          other men.  Moreover, after his baptism, Christ descended upon him in the

          form of a dove from the Supreme Ruler, and that then he proclaimed the

          unknown Father, and performed miracles.  But at last Christ departed from

          Jesus, and that then Jesus suffered and rose again, while Christ remained

          impassible / unsuffering / inasmuch as he was a spiritual being.&quot;

                 Against Heresies, I, 26:1-2.

          Introduction:

          1.   John sets forth his purpose in writing First John, and deepens our faith in

                         God's Word.

          2.   The idea &quot;I write&quot; or &quot;I have written&quot; appears 9 times.

          

          1.   John Wrote To Give God's Saints A Basis for Joy - 1 John 1:4

               A.   Men desire happiness.  1 Peter 3:10.

               B.   Greatest happiness comes from obedience to God's Word.

               C.   We can rejoice in forgiveness of sins.

          

          II.  John Wrote To Urge People To Live Pure Lives - 1 John 2:1-2

               A.   Jesus died for our sins. 1 John 1:2

               B.   Jesus' blood keeps on cleansing saints from sins - 1 John 1:7

               C.   John would motivate people to live pure lives.

          

          III.  John Wrote So Men Might Have the Right Relationships - 

               1 John  2:13-14

               A.   Men need to know the Lord.

               C.   Men need the proper relation to God's Word.

               D.   Brethren need to have the right relationship with each other -

                 1 John 2:8-11, 3:11

          

          IV. John Wrote That God's People Might Have Access to the Truth--

               1 John 2:21

               A.   The Truth shall make you free - John 8:32; 1 Tim. 2:4

	     	                 1 John 2:19

          Introduction

          1.   It is possible for some to &quot;go out&quot; from us. 1 John 2:19

          2.   This danger is seen in the lives of Hymenaeus and Alexander

               (1 Timothy 1:19-20) and Demas (2 Tim. 4:10).

          I.   Some &quot;Go Out&quot; Because of Temptation -- Luke 8:13

               A.   Temptation means generally, a testing or trial, but it also means

                              &quot;solicitation to sin.&quot;  James 1:12-16.

               B.   &quot;Testing&quot; may come from &quot;friends&quot; (1 Pet. 4:3) or lusts of the

                              flesh, eyes, or pride of life.  1 John 2:15.

          II.  Some &quot;Go Out&quot; Because Of:

               A.   &quot;Cares of this life&quot; -- Luke 8:14

               B.   Not &quot;seeking the Kingdom first&quot; -- Matthew 6:33

               C.   &quot;Pleasures of this life&quot; -- Luke 8:14b

          III. Some &quot;Go Out&quot; Because of False Doctrine

               A.   John warned the brethren - 1 John 4:1; 2:26

               B.   Jesus warned His disciples of false teachers - Matt. 7:15

               C.   Paul described people &quot;tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine&quot; 

                              -- Eph. 4:14

               D.   The Galatian Christians had been deceived by a &quot;perverted gospel&quot;

                              -- Gal. 1:6-9.

               E.   Today brethren are led astray by the false doctrines that:

                 1. &quot;The Church of Christ is just a denomination among

                              denominations.&quot; -- Eph. 4:4.

                 2. &quot;Morals are relative and ultimately determined by the

                              situation.&quot; -- Gal. 5:19-21.

                 3. &quot;Truth is subjective, and is obtained through dialogue, and

                              through the direct operation of the Holy Spirit.&quot; -- John 8:32;

                              Jude 1:3

       

   Conclusion:

          1.   These are some reasons brethren become unfaithful.

          2.   Those who &quot;go out&quot; are in the grips of spiritual death -- 1 John 5:16

               a.   A sin unto death is any sin a brother will not confess and repent --

                              1 John 5:16; 1 John 1:6-9.

               b.   Those who &quot;go out&quot; can return -- James 5:19-20.

          3.   One thing more tragic than &quot;going out&quot; from the Lord is dying is that

                         condition.

          4.   And it is just as tragic to never come &quot;into&quot; the Lord in the first place --

                         Galatians 3:27; Romans 6:3-5.
