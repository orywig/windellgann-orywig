color="#000000" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><strong> Thessalonica was a large city of about 200,000 in

     Macedonia, which is today northern Greece.  It's modern name is Salonika.  As

     a strategic commercial center it had attracted a large community of Jews and

     they had a synagogue (Acts 17:1).  Paul was given an opportunity to speak in

     the synagogue for three Sabbath days and &quot;reasoned with them from the

     scriptures,&quot; showing that Jesus of Nazareth came in fulfillment of the Old

     Testament prophesies and promises (Acts 17:2-3).

     

       While some of the Jews believed, there was a greater number of

     God-fearing Greeks and a number of the leading women (Acts 17:4).  The

     Jews, becoming jealous, gathered up some wicked men from the market place

     and formed a mob.  They attacked the house of Jason and took some of the

     brethren before the city authorities and accused them of harboring men &quot;who

     have upset the world and have come here also&quot; (Acts 17:5-8).

     

       Paul's stay in Thessalonica was undoubtedly filled with more adventure

     and activity than Luke's account in Acts could briefly record.  There are three

     factors that seen to indicate this: 

       (1)  there was a large number of Gentile converts there, 

       (2)  Paul engaged in some manual labor during this period (2 Thess. 3:8), 

       (3)  in Phil. 4:16 he indicated that from the Philippian church he had

                 received aid more than once while in other parts of Macedonia.

color="#000000" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><strong>

     

        The church at Thessalonica had been a very faithful active church up to the

     time of this first letter.  Paul speaks of their &quot;work of faith, and labor of love,

     and stedfastness of hope in the Lord Jesus Christ&quot; (I Thess. 1:3).  He also

     states that they had set an example for the believers in Macedonia and Achaia,

     particularly in the fact that from them &quot;the word of the Lord has sounded forth,

     not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward

     God has gone forth&quot; (I Thess. 1:8).

     

        Paul's success with the church there had brought them sever persecution

     from the Jews.  When he was forced to leave them he was very eager to learn

     how things were going and sent Timothy to them (1 Thess. 3:1-5; 2:17). 

     Timothy's report of their steadfastness in the faith and some of the questions

     (especially about Jesus' second coming) may have prompted this letter.

       Paul begins his letters by giving thanks to God for them.  He mentioned

     they had readily received the Gospel even in the face of much tribulation; and

     their zeal and diligence in spreading the Gospel through that part of the world

     was known by all.

     

       Chapter 1.  Thessalonica was a city filled with idolaters, as were many

     others, but &quot;they had turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God&quot;

     (1:9). 

     

       Chapter 2.  In the first part of chapter two Paul emphasizes the

     characteristics of his work among them by pointing out:  1) They had preached

     with boldness in the face of opposition (2:2);  2) Their preaching had been free

     from deceit, and they had spoken so as to please God (2:3-4);  3) They did not

     seek glory from men (2:6);  4)  They had preached the Gospel in love and truth

     and for the Thessalonians (2:8);  5) They had worked with their hands that

     they might not be a burden to the brethren (2:9; 2 Thess. 3:8);  

       

       In this same chapter Paul makes a wonderful statement concerning the

     attitude with which they had received the Gospel: &quot;You accepted it not as the

     word of men, but as it is in truth, the Word of God' (2:13).  Paul stated his

     desire to see them and that Satan had hindered his plans (2:17-18).

     

       Chapter 3.  He explains that when his anxiety over their welfare could

     endure no longer he sent Timothy to strengthen and encourage them (3:1-2). 

     He had warned them that persecution would come (3:3-4) and rejoiced over

     Timothy's good report concerning their faith (3:6-11).

     

       Chapter 4.  Paul emphasized the necessity of boldness in life (4:1-8) and

     exhorted them to brotherly love (4:9-10).  Beginning with vs. 13 he instructs

     them concerning the second coming of Christ and those dead in the Lord and

     exhorts them &quot;to comfort one another with these words.&quot;

     

       Chapter 5.  The need for watchful and sobriety in view of the Lord's

     coming is emphasized (5:1-11).  After a number of brief exhortations

     (5:12-22) Paul concludes the epistle with a prayer (5:23-24), some personal

     requests (5:25-27), and his blessings upon them (5:28).

             I Thessalonians 5:18

     Introduction:

     1.   A magazine published a poll what a number of various people said they

               desired most in life. 

     2.   Paul indicates that he had learned the secret of a thankful life.  This basic

               characteristic of his life comes out in each of his epistles, and even

               including his prison epistles.  &quot;In everything give thanks, for this is God's

               will for you in Christ Jesus.&quot;  (5:18)

     3.   Paul did not just proclaim this principal, he practiced it as well.  Paul was

               thankful for all things, including:

     

     I.  THE SAVIOR

     1.   Paul was thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Thess. 1:1,3

     2.   Paul exclaimed in the letter to the Corinthians, &quot;Thanks be unto God for

               his unspeakable gift&quot; (2 Cor. 9:15).

     

     II. SALVATION

     1.   Paul was not only thankful for who Jesus was but also for what Jesus had

               done. 1 Thess. 5:9.

     2.   Salvation to Paul meant to be saved from something.

     3.   Salvation to Paul meant to be saves for something.

      

     III.  STRENGTH

     1.   As Paul walked up and down the Roman roads he came to know the

               strengthening presence of the Lord.  God not only saves; he also sustains.

     2.   &quot;I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has strengthened me&quot; (I Tim. 1:12,

               NASB).  Philippians 4:13

     

     IV.  THE SAINTS 

     1.   Paul was always thankful for his fellow Christians.  

       a. To the Romans, Paul wrote, &quot;I thank my God through Jesus for you

               all&quot; (Rom. 1:8, NASB).

       b. To the Corinthians he said, &quot;I thank my God always concerning you

               &quot; (I Cor. 1:4, NASB).

       c. To the Ephesians... Eph. 1:16

       d. To the Philippians... Phil. 1:3

     2.   Illustration of a man who said he recognized passing through three stages

               of growth in his life.

     

     V.  SUFFERING

     1.   Paul was even thankful for the difficulties he faced in life for he

               recognized the blessings they added to life. (3:4; 2:14)

       a. To the Colossians Paul wrote, &quot;Now I rejoice in my suffering, for

               your sake&quot; (Col. 1:24, NASB). 

     2.   Why did Paul rejoice in suffering?

       1) First, because in his suffering he reached the end of his own ability, and

            he was forced to really trust in God.  (2 Cor. 4:7, NASV)

       2) Second, because his suffering enabled him to more ably minister to

            others who suffered.  Paul explained that God &quot;comforts us in all our

            affliction so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction

            with the comfort which we ourselves are comforted by God&quot; (2 Cor. 1:4,

            NASB).

       3) Third, because he knew that his suffering could not be compared with

            the glory that God was preparing for him (Romans 8:18).  Some young

            person suggested that the pay for following Christ is not that good, but his

            retirement plan is out of this world!

     3.   Suffering is not the final word in the life of the Christian.

     

     Conclusion:

     &quot;In everything give thanks, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.&quot; 1
