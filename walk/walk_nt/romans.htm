                 Introduction

     

     AUTHOR and DATE

     

       The book of Romans was written by the apostle Paul at Corinth during the

     three month stay in Greece which is mentioned in Acts 20:3.  This was in the

     winter of 57-58 AD.  It was at the close of the third missionary journey and on

     the eve of Paul's departure to Jerusalem with the offering of money for the

     poor saints (Romans 15:22-27).  Within a few days after writing this letter,

     Paul began that journey wherein it was testified to him in every city that he

     passed through that bonds and imprisonment awaited him in Jerusalem.  

     

     THE RECIPIENTS

     

       Paul had long desired to visit Rome.  He wanted to preach the Gospel at

     this seat of earthly power and government.  We do not know who established

     the church in the imperial city of the Caesars but it would seem probable be

     that some of the &quot;strangers of Rome&quot; who were present at Pentecost (Acts

     2:10) started the church there upon their return home.  It is likely that the

     constant influx of strangers from all parts of the empire carried many converts

     to the capitol city.  

     

     

       Long before any apostle visited Italy, the church was established in Puteoli

     and in Rome (Acts 28:14, 15).  There were some Jews in the church of Rome,

     but the majority of the disciples were of Gentile origin (Romans 1:5-7; 11:13-25; 14:1; 15:15,16).   

     

     THE OCCASION

     

       The occasion for Paul writing this letter was the departure of Phoebe from

     Corinth to Rome. As the New Testament was not complete and no apostle had

     ever visited Rome, doubtless many members of the church there had an

     imperfect comprehension of many great principles of Christian doctrine.  It

     was needful that the relations of Jews and Gentile and of the law and the

     gospel be set forth with all clearness.  

     

     

       Paul, doubtless, also wanted to inform the people  of his desire to visit

     Rome when the opportunity presented itself (Romans 1:10-13; 15:24).  Paul

     wanted to answer any misrepresentations and slanders which may have been

     circulated there by him enemies. Legalistic Judaizers were probably attempting

     to deceive the people as they had recently done in Galatia and earlier in

     Antioch, and a clear exposition of justification by faith wa needed by this

     church which was located in such a strategic position (Romans 16:17-19).  

     

     PURPOSE of the BOOK

     

       This letter was written primarily to instruct the Christians in Rome, but

     also for the benefit of all the churches.  The great theme of the book is set forth

     in Romans 1:16 &quot;  the gospel is the power of God unto Salvation to every one

     that believeth, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.&quot;

     

     

       This great truth is taught in the first eleven chapters of Romans.  Paul

     shows that salvation is not by the works of the Law, but through the Gospel

     accepted by faith.  He tells us that man does not merit salvation, but is saved

     by the grace of God on the basis of the sacrifice which Jesus made. The book

     of Romans is one of the most profound ever written.  It has been called the

     gospel in miniature.

          &#12;          Not Ashamed Of The Gospel

                 Romans 1:16

     

     Introduction:

       1. One of the most familiar passages in Romans is 1:16 &quot;For I am not

               ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it the power of God

               unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew

               first and also to the Greek.&quot;

     

     I.   As we look into the life of Paul after his conversion and his writings in the

               New Testament, and particularly the letter to the Romans, we see that there

               wasn't ANY PART of the gospel that he was ashamed of.  For example:

       A. He was not ashamed of the FACTS of the gospel.

          1.   I Cor. 11:1; Acts 13:28-30; Acts 17:16; Acts 26:23; 

            I Cor. 15:1-4;

          2.   You and I need not be ashamed of the gospel today.

       B. Paul was not ashamed to preach that there is but ONE GOSPEL.  

          1.   Eph. 4:5  &quot;one faith&quot;;  Eph. 4:4-6  &quot;one body&quot; Romans 8:24.  Gal.

                    1:8-9 the curse of preaching any other.

          2.   Acts 13:10  Paul was not ashamed to rebuke those who perverted it.

          3.   We should boldly preach and stand for the &quot;one faith&quot;

       C. Paul was not ashamed of the COMMANDS of the gospel.

          1.   He preached the &quot;whole&quot; gospel, Acts 20:27.  He was not ashamed

                    to preach that men must hear the word, Rom. 10:17; believe in

                    Jesus, Acts 16:31; repent of their sins, Acts 17:30; confess their faith

                    in Jesus, Rom. 10:9-10; and preach that baptism is essential for

                    salvation, Rom. 6:5.

          2.   Don't be ashamed of the commands of the gospel.

     

     II.  In the next part of the verse Paul tells WHY he was not ashamed.  &quot;FOR it is

               the power of God unto salvation.&quot;

       The GOSPEL is God's POWER to save the souls of men.

       A. It is God's CONVINCING POWER.  Romans 10:17; 2 Cor. 5:7; John

               20:30-31. It brings men to faith.

       B. It is God's CONVICTING POWER. John 16:7-8; Acts 2:37; It brings

               men to repentance.

       C. It is God's CONVERTING POWER.  Psalms 19:7; Rom 1:16 and 8:2;

               James 1:25; 1 Thess. 2:13.  It teaches men how to get into Christ, Gal.

               3;27

       D. It is God's CONFIRMING POWER. In I John 5:13 John said he wrote

               that they may know they had eternal life.

     

     Conclusion:  Don't be ashamed, the Gospel is God's power unto salvation for all of

            us today.</strong></font></pre>
