       <B> "First Corinthians</B>" <I>Pros Korinthos,</I> is one of several
          letters Paul wrote to the Corinthian church.  We have
          two of those letters. A reference to another letter can
          be found in <a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=1Cor+5:9-13">1Cor 5:9-13</a>.</h4>
<P>

          The background of the church at Corinth can be found in
          Acts chapters 18 and 19.<P>

          
         <H3><b> Author:</b></H3>
  Paul's name is given several times (<!-- pbhtml error 131 (top): invalid passage reference, 17 --><!-- pbhtml error 131 (plainref): invalid passage reference, 22 -->).  The style and language are Paul's
          and the contents harmonize with what we know of Corinth
          in Paul's time.<P>
         
         <H3><b> Date:</b></H3>
  Paul gives the place from which he was writing as
          Ephesus (<a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=1Cor+16:8">1Cor 16:8</a>).  It was probably written
          during the latter part of his stay in Ephesus (<a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=Acts+19">Acts 19</a>)
          about AD 57.<P>
          
       <H3><b>Historical Setting:</b> </H3>
 The city of Corinth was
          strategically located on the isthmus of land that
          connects the lower peninsula of Greece with the
          mainland.  Descriptions of Corinth found in ancient
          writings state that there were many temples in Corinth,
          some devoted to Egyptian deities.  There was a temple to
          Venus (Greek= Aphrodite) where a 1000 female slaves gave
          themselves in prostitution to the worshippers.  They had
          engraved on the soles of their sandals an inscription
          that left the words "Follow Me" imprinted in the sand. 
          The term "corinthianize" became synonymous with drunken
          and immoral debauchery.  The materialism of the city
          left lives empty, but Christianity could fill that need. 
         <P> 
<H3><b> To Whom Written:</b></H3>
  Paul came to Corinth for the first
          time on his second missionary journey (<a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=Acts+18:1-17">Acts 18:1-17</a>),
          with much weakness, fear and trembling (<a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=1Cor+2:3">1Cor 2:3</a>), and
          established the body of Christ.  As is so often true,
          the local culture threatened to affect the church more
          than the church could affect the culture.
       <P>   
            Corinthian Christians were "saints", the "church of
          God," but they were engaged in things contrary to the
          Christian life.  Reports had been delivered to Paul
          concerning their conduct and irregular behavior with
          regard to unity, attitude, life, and worship.  Paul
          therefore wrote to rebuke, correct, and challenge the
          saints, and what he writes is of great importance to the
          church in every age.
         <P> 
         <B> <H3>The Message: </H3>
 </B>The names "Jesus" and "Christ" appear in
          1 Corinthians some 85 times.  The title "Lord" appears an
          additional 61 times.  For Paul, everything is founded in
          Jesus "through whom all things came and through whom we
          live" (<a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=1Cor+8:6">1Cor 8:6</a>).
       <P>   
            The core of Paul's message is Christ.  He insists
          that the most important topic he discussed with these
          Christians was the death, burial, and resurrection of
          Jesus (<a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=1Cor+15:3-8">1Cor 15:3-8</a>).  When he sums up the essence of his
          message, it is "Christ crucified" (<a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=1Cor+1:23">1Cor 1:23</a>).  Paul likes to
          show how the cross-- which seems to be evidence of
          weakness and appears so foolish to many-- is really
          evidence of great power (<a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=1Cor+1:18">1Cor 1:18</a>) and wisdom (<a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=1Cor+1:18-2:16,+3:18-20,+8:1-3">1Cor 1:18-2:16, 3:18-20, 8:1-3</a>).
         <P> 
         <B><H3> Background: </H3>
</B> It appears that after Paul established the
          church in Corinth about AD 50 and left them that he
          wrote the church a letter which has not been preserved
          by the Holy Spirit.  In turn, Paul received disturbing
          news about the disciples at Corinth along with a letter
          from them about a number of questions they wanted him to
          answer about the Christian life.  
         <P> 
            The city of Corinth was as wicked as any city today
          and like so many churches now the Corinthian church had
          allowed the world to enter.  One writer wrote of them
          saying: 
          <P>
                        <BLOCKQUOTE> "They were carnal, immature, immoral,
                         selfish, proud, heretical, and divisive. 
                         They were enamored with human philosophy. 
                         They identified with little cliques which
                         followed different spiritual leaders.  They
                         tolerated sin, fornication, and incest. 
                         They took each other to court, abused God's
                         intended role for men and women, and were
                         gluttonous and drunken at the Lord's
                         Supper.  They allowed pagan worship ritual
                         to be brought into their own worship,
                         perverted and abused spiritual gifts, and
                         [didn't understand]... the resurrection. 
                         They had managed to drag into the church
                         all the old practices of the world.  They
                         had not made a clear distinction between
                         the holy and the profane!"</BLOCKQUOTE>
          
            With so many problems at Corinth the letter
          serves to show us how a church can deal with such
          problems in the lives of Christians today.  It is
          therefore, an important practical letter for
          churches in our time.
          
        <H3> <b> Outline:</b> </H3>
 Because of the background of the letter
          noted in the previous paragraph and Paul's
          response, we want to outline the book in terms of
          their problems and Paul's response.<P>

    WHAT IS THE LORD'S SUPPER?
          
    1.  A memorial feast, <a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=Luke+22:19;+1Cor+11:25">Luke 22:19; 1Cor 11:25</a>b.

        elements.
        a.   Bread, the staff of life, (<a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=Pss+105:16">Pss 105:16</a>)

    WHY EAT OF THE LORD'S SUPPER
          
    1. He commands us to do so, <a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=Luke+22:19">Luke 22:19</a>.

    3. To keep in contact with him let we forget.
          
    WHEN SHOULD THE LORD'S SUPPER BE EATEN?
          
    1. Jesus said &quot;This do in remembrance of me.&quot;
    2. We should want to remember him often.
    3. The Apostles put it on the &quot;first day of the 
       week,&quot; <a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=Acts+20:7;+1Cor+16:2;+Rev+1:10">Acts 20:7; 1Cor 16:2; Rev 1:10</a>.

    4. The &quot;first day&quot; comes once a week.
    5. As other services, not to be neglected, Heb.10:25.
          
    WHO SHOULD EAT OF THE SUPPER?
          
    1. Citizens of the kingdom, <a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=Luke+22:29-30">Luke 22:29-30</a>.

       a.   Infants and some handicapped can not
            &quot;discern.&quot;
       b.   They who can discern, but do not, drink
            judgment unto themselves, <a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=1Cor+11:29">1Cor 11:29</a>.
    3. Citizens who have examined themselves, <a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=1Cor+11:28">1Cor 11:28</a>.
       a.   If they have repented of sin, <a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=Mat+5:23-24">Mat 5:23-24</a>.
       b.   If they put the Lord first, <a href="http://negus.uchicago.edu:1080/cgi-bin/pbcgi?sourceform=pbeasy.html&maxhits=25&searchtype=fetch&version=kjv-g&searchstring=John+21:4,15">John 21:4,15</a>. We should neither invite nor forbid.
