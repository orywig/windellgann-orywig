          <P>

         <H4> AUTHOR:</H4>

 John, whose surname was Mark, is the writer (Acts 12:12, 25). 

          He was the son of a certain Mary of Jerusalem and cousin of Barnabas

          (Colossians 4:10). <P>

          

            From the fact that the family had large facilities and servants attending the

          door, Mary appears well off and probably an influential member in the early

          Jerusalem church.  It has been suggested that the upper room may have been

          at her home and that it continued as a meeting place for the apostles (Cf. Acts

          1:13).<P>

          

            Although Mark was a source of contention between Paul and Barnabas at

          the beginning of the second missionary journey, we see him working with Paul

          and highly favored a few years later (Col. 4:10; Philemon 24).  Mark also

          worked with Peter and is referred to as his "son" much like Timothy was by

          Paul.  Many believe the young man of Mark 14:51-53 was none other than the

          young Mark himself.

          <P>

         <H4> BACKGROUND: </H4>

 One of the pupils of the apostle John said that Mark wrote

          down exactly, without mistake, the words and deeds of Christ though not in

          chronological order.  He says that the Mark wrote down the substance of

          Peter's preaching.

          <P>

         <H4> PURPOSE: </H4>

 From Mark 10:45 we can easily determine Mark's object in

          writing his gospel account, "For even the Son of man came not to be

          ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many." 

          <P>

         <H4> CHARACTERISTICS:</H4>

  Mark is the briefest of the four gospel accounts.  It

          is a narrative of dynamic action.  Jesus is presented as "doing" rather than

          merely "saying." <P>

          1.   "Straightway" and "immediately" are used more than 40 times.<P>

          2.   Mark repeatedly speaks of the impact, the awe, and astonishment that

                         Jesus made on the mind and heart of those who heard him. cf. Mark 1:22;

                         1:27; 4:41; 6:51; 10:24, 26, etc.<P>

          

          3.   Mark tells us more about the emotions of Jesus than other writers. He

                         pictures Jesus:<P>

          <UL>

            a. Sighing deeply in His spirit -- 7:34; 8:12.<BR>

            b. Moved with compassion -- 6:31.<BR>

            c. Marvelling at their unbelief -- 6:6.<BR>

            d. Moved with righteous anger -- 3:5; 8:33; 10:14.<BR>

            e. Looking with love on the rich young ruler -- 10:21.<BR>

            f. Feeling the pangs of hunger -- 11:12.<BR>

            g. Becoming tired and needing rest -- 6:31.<BR>

          </UL>

          4.   Mark repeatedly inserts little vivid details which are the hall-marks of an

                         eye-witness. <P><UL>

            a. Cf. the added detail to Matthew 18:2 found in Mark 9:36; <BR>

            b. Cf. Matthew 19:13-15, Luke 18:15-17 and Mark 10:13-16; <BR>

            c. Mark alone tells how the 5000 were seated, and how they looked like

                         plots of vegetable rows in a garden -- 6:40; <BR>

            d. Cf. Jesus and disciples on their last journey to Jerusalem -- Matt.

                         20:17; Luke 18:31; with Mark 10:32. <BR>

            e. In the story of Jesus stilling the tempest Mark adds one little sentence

                         that makes the picture vivid before our eyes -- 4:38a.<BR>

         </UL> 

          5.   Mark is very fond of the historic present.  He speaks of events in the

                         present tense instead of the past.<P>

          

          6.   Mark often gives us the very Aramaic words Jesus spoke.  Indicative of

                         an eye-witness.  Mark always then gives the interpretation of those

                         Aramaic words revealing to us he is writing for non-Hebrews (cf. 5:41; 

                         7:34; 7:11; 14:36; 15:34).<P>

           <BLOCKQUOTE> (These may have been times when Peter could hear again the very sound of Jesus' voice, and could not help givin g in his sermons the very words

                      that Jesus uttered.)</BLOCKQUOTE>

          

          7.   Mark made more use of Latin loanwords than the other gospel accounts

                         and some occur in the New Testament only in Mark.  [Note also the

                         evidence of Mark 15:21 and Romans 16:13 which ties his gospel to a

                         Roman audience.]<P>

          

          8.   Mark presents Jesus as being addressed as Rabbi or Teacher whereas

                         Matthew and Luke represent Jesus as being addressed by the title "Lord." 

                         Some say Matthew and Luke reflect the post-resurrection practice of

                         speaking of Jesus while Mark is faithful to the pre-resurrection way of

                         addressing Jesus.<P>

          

          

         <H3> DESIGN:</H3>


           <P>

            Purpose --  The very first verse of Mark provides a clear indication of the

          writer's purpose:  to set forth "the good news" and to bear witness to Jesus

          as the Messiah and the Son of God.

          <P>

            Miracles --  Mark shows Jesus as the miracle-working Servant of God

          attending to man.  Mark's picture is a motion picture showing Jesus in action

          moving men to God!  The Gospel records 35 miracles that Jesus

          worked.<BR>

          <UL>

           <LI> 17 miracles of physical healing<BR>

         </UL> 

          Most of the Lord's miracles, however, are unrecorded (cf. Matthew 14:23;

          Luke 4:40; Matthew 15:30-31; 19:1-2; Luke 6:17-19; Mark 1:32-34; and

          John 21:25, etc.)  The purpose of His miracles were to authenticate the Servant

          as the Son of God (John 15:24; 20:30,31; Mark 16:20; Hebrews 2:3-4). <P>

          "And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and

          many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these

          things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such

          mighty works are wrought by his hands?"  Mark 6:2.<P>

          

          INTRODUCTION<P>

          

          1.   "Never man spake like this man" -- John 7:46; Mark 7:5-13.<P>

          2.   We may go back to the opening chapters of Genesis and read "And the

                         Lord God commanded man, saying..." (2:16).  Thus God became the first

                         instructor and man the first pupil.  God instructed man concerning His

                         Will for him.<P>

          3.   An analysis of the Bible's account of this first teaching situation reveals

                         at least 3 things to us:<P><UL>

            1) That God's purpose was to maintain the perfect relationship that

                         existed between man and Himself in the creation.<BR>

            2) That His method was positive and authoritative.  There was nothing

                         obscure, indefinite, or uncertain about what God said.  It was "The

                         Lord God commanded the man, saying..."<BR>

            3) That as long as man obeyed, God's purpose was achieved.  It was

                         when man presumed to know more than his teacher that the hitherto

                         happy relationship was dissolved.<P>

</UL>




          4.   When man disobeyed God and fell into sin the situation between them was

                         altered.  God still loved man and continued to act as his Teacher, but his

                         purpose was no longer to maintain a perfect relationship. It was to restore

                         it.<P>
