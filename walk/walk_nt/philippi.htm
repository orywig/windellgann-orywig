                 Introduction

     

     THE CHURCH:   The Philippian church was established by Paul on his

     second missionary journey, ca. AD 50 (cf. Acts 16).  He was there &quot;many

     days.&quot;  The church seems to be the least Jewish of all the communities where

     Paul established churches.  Several women were prominent in the history of

     this congregation; there was Lydia, the first convert there, and Euodia and

     Syntyche who are designated as Paul's fellow-laborers in the Gospel.

       This congregation seems to have been exceedingly mindful of Paul's needs

     while he was traveling as a missionary preaching the gospel and sent money

     to him again and again.  They were concerned about his comfort and

     necessities while in prison and again sent him relief.  

     

     PLACE, DATE, AND OCCASION OF WRITING:  The letter reflects that

     it was written during an imprisonment of some duration (1:7, 13f, 17).  While

     Paul was in prison at several different places the evidence is strongest that it

     was written from Rome.  He refers to the praetorium guard (1:13) and Caesar's

     household (4:22).  The date of the epistle if written during first Roman

     imprisonment would be AD 61-64.  

       The letter was occasioned by a series of communications between the

     Philippian church and Paul.  They heard of Paul's imprisonment and need and

     sent their minister, Epaphroditus, to Rome with an offering for Paul. 

     Epaphroditus became seriously sick but God spared him in answer to Paul's

     prayers.  The Philippians then heard of their minister's sickness and were

     grieved over him.  Epaphroditus is now well and Paul sends him back home

     with this letter of thanksgiving for the gift sent to him.

     

     CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EPISTLE:  Philippians is a letter to

     personal friends, not a sermon as Romans, Hebrews and I John.  It is a love

     letter and Paul praises his beloved friends.  It is filled with commendation and

     encouragement, gratitude and love.

       It is a letter of joy.  Paul might be scourged in the day but by midnight he

     could be rejoicing.  It has some important teachings on God, and especially of

          Christ and his pre-incarnated state.&#12;              THE MIND OF CHRIST

               Philippians 2:5

     

     Introduction:

     

     1.   Nineteen times Paul mentions joy, rejoicing, or gladness in this

               epistle.  This is even more meaningful when we notice Paul's situation

               when he wrote the letter.  If we can master Philippians we should be filled

               with joy as we live the Christian life.

     2.   Paul wrote not wanting anything to mar the joy of the Philippian

               Christians.  He did not want the &quot;Joy Stealers&quot; to get the upper hand.

       a. Illustration about &quot;Happiness Robbers&quot;

       b. &quot;These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might

               remain in you, and that your joy might be full. (John

               15:11)  Isn't it sad today that so many Christians walk under clouds

               of gloom when we could be walking in the sunshine of joy.

     3.   Just how does Christian joy differ from ordinary happiness?

       _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

     4.   The Christian secret of joy is found in the way we _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

               (Proverbs 23:7)

       A. Notice the contrast between Mark Twain and Paul.

     5.   Paul indicates four thieves that could rob us of our joy and how we can

               prevent it.  Four broad categories suggested by Paul are:

          Chapter 1   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

          Chapter 2      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

          Chapter 3      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

          Chapter 4      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

     6.   How can we prevent these thieves from taking what is ours in Christ?  

       a. By cultivating the Christian mind and attitude (2:5).

       b. Paul used the word &quot;mind&quot; ten times, and &quot;think&quot; and &quot;remember&quot;

               five times each.  Let us notice how Paul develops the right &quot;mind-set&quot;

               in each of the chapters:

     

     I.   The Single Mind  Chapter 1  (Key verse 21)

     

     1.   How does Paul describe the singlemindedness that James  mentions? &quot;A double

               minded man is unstable in all his ways.&quot; (James 1:8)

        It is having all of one's life centered on Jesus Christ.  Everything we think, plan.

            do, hope for, takes its meaning and purpose from the Lord.

     2.   Does a single-minded person simply ignore the circumstances in which he finds

               himself, acting as if they didn't exist? 

       _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

     

     II.  The Submissive Mind  Chapter 2  (Key verse 3)

     

     1.   In chapter 2 Paul focuses on people and provides us with four wonderful

               examples of the submissive mind  (Luke 14:11).

          2:1-11      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _      (v.6-7)

          2:12-18   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _     (v.16-17)

          2:19-24   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _     (v.20)

          2:25-30   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _     (v.30)

     

     2.   The Christian with the submissive mind doesn't expect others to serve

               him.  

     

     3.   We see how in chapter 1 Paul puts Jesus first, and in chapter 2 he shows

               us to put others second.  That means you put yourself last, and notice how

               that spells JOY!

     

     III. The Spiritual Mind  Chapter 3  (Key verse 19)

     

     1.   Eleven times &quot;things&quot; are mentioned.  We see that 'most people' mind

               &quot;earthly things&quot;  

       a. Paul probably has in mind things which are always sinful, but he

               doesn't list them.

       b. &quot;Things&quot; that concern us may include some necessary but secondary

               things as food, clothing and shelter.  &quot;The worst enemy of the best is

               the second best.&quot;  Matthew 6:33.

     

     2.   Christians are to mind &quot;heavenly things&quot; (verse 20).  The person with

               a spiritual mind looks at things from heaven's point of view.  What a

               difference.

     

     3.   Paul uses several figures of speech in chapter 3 as he considers the need

               for the Christian to develop a spiritual minds from the standpoint of:

            Accountants-- with right values  (v. 1-11) v.7

            Athletes-- with right vigor  (v. 12-16) v.14

            Aliens-- with right vision  (17-21) v.20

     

     III. The Secure Mind  Chapter 4  (Key verse 7)

     

     1.   The Christian with joy has a peaceful and secure mind.  The great enemy

               of the secure mind is  _ _ _ _ _ .

       a. &quot;Peace of mind,&quot; the basic characteristic of Christian joy cannot

               coexist with worry for that involves feelings of insecurity or feelings

               of threatened danger.

     

     2.   Paul indicates that worry involves the mind-- 

          wrong     _ _ _ _ _ _ 

       and that worry involves the heart (emotions)-- 

          wrong     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 

       about circumstances, people and things.  So if we develop the single

            mind, the submissive mind, and the spiritual mind as we should we will

            not have much problem with worry.

     

     3.   Four wonderful spiritual resources we have in Christ for joyful, peaceful,

               worry-free minds are:

       a. (4:1-9)     God's P _ _ _ _  v.7

       b. (4:10-13) God's P _ _ _ _  v.13

       c. (4:14-19) God's P _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  v.19

       d. (4:20-23) God's P _ _ _ _ _  v.21-22.

     

     Conclusion:

     

     1.   What should you and I do?

     2.   Notice that each chapter in Philippians begins with either &quot;in Christ&quot; or

               &quot;in the Lord.&quot;  When we give ourselves to Christ we no longer belong to

               the world.

     3.   We can see how the Philippians gave themselves to God in Acts 16.

       a. They were told to: _ _ _ _ _ _ _  (Acts 16:31)

       b. We see evidence of  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   (Acts 16:33)

       e. We see that they were  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  in obedience to the commands

               of the Lord (Acts 16:33, Mark 16:16).
