                 INTRODUCTION
     
     1.   The book of Genesis is the book of origins.
     2.   The scope of the book is &quot;From Bereshith
               (Hebrew word beginning) to Shiloh
               (Genesis 1;1; 49:10).&quot;
     3.   The book revolves around three significant ideas:
       a. Generation - Genesis 1 - 2. The beginnings of things.
       b. Degeneration - Genesis 3 - 11.  The
                 story of how evil entered the human
                 history and its early movements.
       c. Regeneration - Genesis 12 - 50.  The
               story of God calling a man, the
               beginning of a nation and preparation
               for the coming of Christ.
     4.   The book can also be remembered around
               the lives of six men.
       a. Adam      -    Genesis 1-5 
       b. Noah      -    Genesis 6-11   
       c. Abraham   -    Genesis 12-25     
       d. Isaac     -    Genesis 26-27
       e. Jacob     -    Genesis 27-36
       f. Joseph    -    Genesis 37-50
     
                  DISCUSSION
     
     I.   ADAM  Ch. 1-5 
     
     First: The Beginning  (Genesis 1:1)
     
       A. This verse carries us back to the
               beginning of everything.
       B. It  states the five fundamental facts
               of science.
          1.   Time      - &quot;In the beginning..&quot;
          2.   Force     - &quot;...God...&quot;
          3.   Actions   - &quot;...created...&quot;
          4.   Space     - &quot;...the heavens...&quot;
          5.   Matter    - &quot;...and the earth.&quot;
       C. It assumes the existence of God. 
       D. This simple sentence denies atheism,
               polytheism, and it confesses the one
               Eternal Creator. 
       E. This verse affirms that something has
               always existed.  Something never comes
               from nothing.
       F. God Created
          1.   There are three words used in the
                    first two chapters regarding the
                    beginning of things.
            a. Bara - (created)
               (1)  To create something from
                         nothing.
               (2)  It is used only three times in
                         the first chapter. 1:1, 21, 27.
            b. Asah - (to make)  Form out of
                    pre-existing material, as a man
                    takes lumber to make a desk. 
                    Genesis 1:7, 16, 26, 31;  2:18.
            c. Yatsar - (form)  Form out of pre-existing
                    material. Genesis 2:7, 19.
       G. The days were 24 hour periods of time,
               not long geological ages, 1:31; cf.
               Exodus 20:11.  Objections to long
               periods of time:
            1.      It is unnecessary; 
            2.      Every time the term day has a
                         definite number before it, it
                         refers to a 24 hour period of
                         time; 
            3. The &quot;Botany&quot; argument; 
            4. Adam's extreme age if every day
                    millions of years.
     
     Second: The Beginning of Man and Woman 
             (Gen  1:26-27; 2:18-25
     
       A. Man was created in the image of God
               (1:26).
       B. Man given dominion over all of God's
               creation (1:28).
       C. Man placed in the garden of Eden with
               one prohibition  (2:15-17).
       D. Man given a mate - the beginning of
               marriage (2:18-25).
     
     Third: The Beginning of Sin 
            (Genesis 3:1-6).
     
       A. The tempter was the devil (3:1).
       B. The avenue of temptation were (Genesis
               3:6):
          1.   Lust of eyes
          2.   Lust of the flesh
          3.   Pride of life
       C. The consequence:  (Genesis 3:11-24)
          1.   Driven from the garden.
          2.   Serpent to crawl upon his belly.
          3.   Woman to have pain in child bearing.
          4.   Ground cursed.
          5.   Man to earn his living by sweat of
                    his face  (Genesis 3:19).
     
     Fourth:  The First Prophecy of Redemption
               (Gen 3:15).
     
       A. The seed of woman was to bruise the
               head of the serpent.
       B. Christ was born of a virgin - the seed
               of woman (Matthew 1:23).
       C. Christ was made of woman when the
               fulness of time came (Galatians 4:4).
     
     II.  NOAH  Ch. 6-11  
     
       A. Man became exceeding wicked on the
               earth (Genesis 6:5).
       B. God determined to destroy the whole
               human race on the earth, but Noah
               found grace in God's eyes (Gen. 6:8-14).
       C. Noah did all that God commanded him to
               do (Gen. 6:22).
     
     III. ABRAHAM  Ch. 12-25  
         (Gen 12:1-3;  13:15-16;  15:5, 18;  17:5-8;
              17:19;  22:17-18.
     
          Four elements in God's marvelous promise
               to Abraham
     
       A. A nation for carrying out the promise
               - &quot;I will make of thee a great
               nation.&quot;
       B. A land for habitation - &quot;Unto thy seed
               have I given this land&quot; (Genesis
               15:18).
       C. A God to bless - &quot;I will bless thee&quot; 
               (Genesis 22:17).
       D. A coming Savior for all nations - &quot;And
               in thy seed shall the nations of the
               earth be blessed&quot; (Gen. 22:18; Cf.
               Gal. 3:16)
     
     IV.    ISAAC Ch. 26-27  
     
       A. Genesis 26:3-5  God Repeated The
               Promise to Isaac, That was beginning
               to be fulfilled in him (Gen 26:3-5).  
      
     V.     JACOB  Genesis 28-36  
     
       A. When Jacob was ready to leave home,
               Isaac repeated God's promise to
               Abraham (Gen. 28:3-4; 13-15).
       B. God appeared to Jacob at Bethel and
               repeated the promise (Gen. 35:10-12).
       
     VI.    JOSEPH  Genesis 37 - 50
     
       A. Joseph is sold into Egypt and rises to
               power (Gen 37-40).
       B. After interpreting Pharaoh's dreams,
               Joseph is placed in a position to help
               his people (Genesis 41).
       C. After Joseph reveals himself to his
               brothers he assures them that God has
               used their evil deed for good (Genesis
               45:5-7; 50:15-20).
       D. Jacob in blessing his sons mentions
               the coming of Shiloh (Genesis 49:10).
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     1.   So the book of beginnings ends with the
               great faith that God would bring them
               into the land he had promised (Genesis
               50:24-25).
     2.   How does Genesis connect with &quot;the glory
               of God and the salvation of man through
               Jesus Christ&quot; ?
       a. God's revelation makes known the
               origin of the universe, of man and of
               sin.
       b. It unfolds the development of the
               Messianic nation.
       c. It looks into the future and foretells
               the coming of the &quot;promised seed,&quot; the
               Savior--Shiloh.

            Dispersion of Nations
                       
                Genesis 11:1-9
     
     Introduction:
     1.   In Gen 10 we read of the dispersion of
               Noah's descendants.
     2.   In Gen 11 the building of the city and
               tower of Babel.
       a. This incident prompted the dispersion
               of Gen. 10:31,32.
     
     I.   REBELLION AGAINST GOD
       1. They built to keep united.  Didn't
               want to scatter.  Their's was a
               rebellious society &quot;No, we don't want
               to!&quot;  They built to establish a
               rallying point that might serve to
               maintain their unity.
       2. But God had told them to replenish the
               earth (9:1).
       3. God won't tolerate rebellion.  Sounds
               like today!  God gives us the standard
               to regulate morals and ethics but men
               and women say, &quot;No, we don't want
               them!  We want to set our own
               standards.&quot;  (Which is NO standard.)
     
     II.  FORGETTING GOD'S PURPOSE
       1. God's purpose was that men should
               scatter and replenish the entire
               earth.  His purpose was not prevented
               though man tried.
       2. Often we forget God's purposes and
               decide upon our own course of action.
       3. Consider God's purpose for the church
               and how men have tried to thwart that
               purpose.
          a.   Social Gospel; Humanism; A Divided
                    Christendom
       4. Consider God's plan for marriage and
               the home and how our society today is
               perverting and failing God's plan.
       5. God's plan for man is happiness.  And
               He shows the way of life in which it
               can be achieved.
          a.   Why are so many unhappy?
          b.   &quot;Getters Vs Givers&quot;  &quot;To give is
                    happier than to get&quot; (Acts 20:35,
                    Moffatt Translation).
     
     III. EVIL ECUMENICAL MOVEMENTS
       1. Forget what God says...let's build one
               big city!
       2. &quot;Doing things the same way won't mean
               a thing unless we are doing it right.&quot; 
                Illustration: A new supervisor
     
     IV.    AN INSPECTION OF OUR WORK  (vs. 5)
       1. No work can hope to escape the eye of
               God. Prov.15:3
       2. Every work will be judged by God
               (Eccl. 12:14).
       3. Rebellion will not go un-noticed.
     
     CONCLUSION:
       1. Dispersion of nations at Babel.
       2. Nations of the world united at the
               cross.
