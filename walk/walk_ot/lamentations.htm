<br>
The titles of the books in the Hebrew Bible usually came from the very first
word, in this case Ekah which may be translated into English &quot;alas&quot; or
&quot;how sad it is.&quot; The scholars who translated the O.T. into Greek
during the intertestamental period (and later into Syriac and Latin) applied the
longer title &quot;The Lamentations of Jeremiah.&quot;<br>
<br>
This five chapter book is neglected today as a somber and gloomy record of
Jeremiah weeping over the ruins of Jerusalem. But it is more that just &quot;a
cloudburst of grief, a river of tears, a sea of sobs&quot; as one writer called
it. This poem is an affirmation of faith in the justice and goodness of God.<br>
<br>
True, the author had tasted pain and sorrow and endured frustration and
loneliness, but he clings to an undaunted faith which triumphs over
circumstances. The book endeavors to explain history and place calamities in
proper perspective.&nbsp; When the Christian understands it's purpose we see how
wonderfully this book contributes to our understanding of calamities and
catastrophes.</font></p>

<b><font color="#0000FF">The Background and Occasion of the Book</font></b><br>
<br>
The destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC was God's judgement for the idolatry and
rebellion of Judah against Him. God has been patient and longsuffering with them
but finally had to chastise Jerusalem for her horrible behavior.<br>
<br>
Nebuchadnezzar laid siege to Jerusalem for eighteen long months. Lamentations
describes in the most vivid manner the terrible suffering to which the Jews were
subjected. When the city was captured the Chaldean king ordered it completely
demolished.<br>
<br>
To see their beloved sacred city go up in flames was a shocking, sad experience.
Despite Jeremiah's warning the city was unprepared for it. For over a hundred
years since the miraculous deliverance of Jerusalem in the days of king Hezekiah
the popular notion had been that Jerusalem was inviolable and secure. (Micah
3:11b)<br>
<br>
<font color="#008000">[Q-1] </font>Investigative Question: What had been the
predominate message of the false prophets? (Micah 3:11b; Jer. 6:14; 8:11;

Lamentation had Jeremiah written? (2 Chronicles 35:24-25)<br>
<br>
The theme of the book is a lament over the terrible woes which had fallen upon
sinful Judah and over the destruction of the Holy City and the Temple of God.
The books consists of four funeral hymns (dirges), ch. 1-4; and one prayer, ch.
5 written in those agonizing days following the destruction of Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
For the most part, the poems describe the adversity of the people, their land,
the city, and the cause of it. Here are their confessions of sin, declarations
of penitence and appeals that they not be forgotten.</font></p>

<b><font color="#0000FF">The Form and Structure of Lamentations</font></b><br>
<br>
The book is entirely in poetic form. Hebrew poetry does not involve rhyme (as a
rule) but rather of thought. The second and third lines repeat the thought of
the first in different words (synonymous parallelism).<br>
<br>
The four dirges are in the form of alphabetic acrostics in which each verse
begins with successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Chapter 3 contains
sixty-six verses with 3 verses assigned to each Hebrew letter.<br>
<br>
The reasons for using such acrostic patterns was usually to serve as mnemonic
devices to aid the memory when the hymns were publicly recited or sung.<br>
<br>
It may be also that the author used this technique in order to give a sense of
completeness to the expression of grief.&nbsp; When&nbsp; one goes from a to a
(so to speak) in expressing his grief he seems to have said all that can be
said. (Psalm 25; 34; 35; 111; 112; 119; 145; Proverbs 31:10-31).</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>Purpose and Use</b></font><br>
<br>
The book served the purpose of helping the people of Judah maintain their faith
in God in the midst of overwhelming disaster. Lamentations expresses the
convictions that God had dealt justly with His people. The writer wants the
people to recognize the righteousness of God's dealings with them and to cast
themselves upon the mercy of the Lord.<br>
<br>
Lamentations is read in Jewish synagogues on the ninth of the month of Ab (which
falls at the end of July or early August), a fast day which commemorates the
destruction of the Temple by Babylon in 586 BC and the Romans in AD 70.</font></p>

Text: <font color="#FF0000"><b>Lamentations 1:1-9</b></font><br>
<br>
Chapter one has two major divisions. In vs. 1-11 the prophet laments the present
condition of Zion and alludes to his own personal agony twice. In vs. 12-22 the
city itself laments over its condition. The entire chapter is written in
acrostic style.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">In verses 1-7 we have a description of the condition of the
city, and verses 8-9 give an explanation for that condition.&nbsp; Then verse
9b-11 is a prayer to God concerning her.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Verse 1-3. Jerusalem is personified as a widowed princess who
sits alone in the night weeping over the loss of her husband and children.
Loneliness of widowhood is emphasized. Jerusalem's &quot;lovers&quot; (idol
gods) and her &quot;neighbors&quot; (political allies) deserted her.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Verse 4-5. The roads are weeping because no pilgrims are
traveling to Jerusalem for the religious holidays. No crowds mingling at the
gate, no merchants, no sacrifices.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Verse 6-7. The Widowed daughter of Zion is ugly, weak and
helpless. All her beauty is gone.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Verse 8-9. The poet presents the reason for Zion's present
misery. She lived only for the present.</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Some Lessons</b></font><br>

<br>
3. We ought to study God's word and have it in our hearts so we can repeat it's
admonitions and warnings.</font></p>
