          whose name the books bear, Samuel.  But not all of it could be
          authored by him, for it records his death and some subsequent events. 
          I Chronicles 29:29-30 provides the information for us that the
          material in this time of Israel's history was recorded by Samuel, and
          the prophets Nathan and Gad who followed him.

               Samuel was Judge, Prophet and Priest.  He was a Levite, a
          descendant of Kohath (1 Chron. 6:26, 33), and was not redeemed at
          birth but was dedicated to the Lord from his infancy (thus he
          belonged to God and God's use).  Geographically he was an
          Ephraimite.

          general Joab, and of Goliath, Jonathan and the rebellion of David's

          all occur within the time frame of these two books of the Old

          1.   From Eli, Samuel, and David we learn that it is possible for great
                         men to fail as fathers.
          
          2.   From Saul we also learn that great advantages and remarkable
                         opportunities do not guarantee success.
          
          3.   We learn that there is nothing that will take the place of
                         obedience to God  (I Samuel 15:22).
          
          4.   The experiences of the past are recorded to provide lessons of
                         warning and encouragement for the present (Romans 15:4).

          2.   From the time of Israel's civil war between generals Joab and
                         Abner we learn a lesson about the folly of division (A house

          3.   There is a major lesson to be learned from David on the folly of
                         fleshly lusts which war against the soul.
          
          4.   We can learn a great lesson on the proper attitude needed for the

               a.   David recognized the chief good even in his enemies
                              (2 Samuel 2:33, 38).
               b.   The contents of a prayer from a sincere and thankful heart (2
                              Samuel 7:18-29).
               c.   The proper attitude in the death of a child (2 Samuel 22-23)
               d.   The kind of friend that no one needs  (2 Samuel 13:1-3).
               e.   The feelings of old age (2 Samuel 19:35).
               f.   When it is better to fall into God's hands rather than men's (2
                              Samuel 24:14).

                                      2 Samuel 9
          Introduction:

          1.   The story of David and Mephibosheth is one of the many fine
                         stories in the Old Testament with a great lesson for us today
                         (Romans 15:4).

          2.   It points out some of the finer virtues of a good character and
                         emphasizes the value of good friendships and their effect in later
                         life.

          3.   The background on the story of Mephibosheth (2 Samuel 4).
               
          I.   DAVID and MEPHIBOSHETH
          
          1.   David had a  desire to remember for good Saul and Jonathan
                         (2 Samuel 9:1) &quot;Is there anyone left of the house of Saul that I
                         may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?&quot;

               a.   Our thoughts in hours of quietness when alone show what we
                              really are at heart.

               b.   Do we fill our heart and dwell on mistreatment we have
                              received from others?

               c.   Do we look for opportunities to do good?
          
          2.   From David we see the power of sacred associations and
                         friendship of the past.

               a.   Evidently this thought came upon David as he walked down
                              memory lane and his soul was touched again by his memories
                              of Jonathan's friendship.

               b.   The power of good memories can have long lasting effect
                              upon others.
          
          II.  FOR JONATHAN'S SAKE   (2 Samuel 9:7)
          
          1.   Children may be blessed after their parents are gone by good
                         deeds done to others.

          2.   Nothing could be done for Jonathan but that was no excuse for
                         doing nothing.  He could do the next best thing.

               a.   One person was overheard saying, &quot;I don't know how I will
                              ever be able to repay all the kindness shown me.&quot;
          
          CONCLUSION:

          1.   Picture what David did &quot;For Jonathan's Sake&quot; for  Mephibosheth.

          2.   Picture what God has done &quot;For Jesus' Sake&quot; for us.
               a.   2 Cor. 4:5;  Eph. 4:32.

          3.   What if Mephibosheth had rejected David's love?
