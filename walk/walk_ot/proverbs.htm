           The collection of Proverbs in the Bible is attributed to King
          Solomon, the son of David (1:1; 10:1; 25:1) and to Agur (30:1), King
          Lemuel (31:1) and wise men (22:17; 24:23).
          
           Some hold to the view that King Lemuel was another name for
          Solomon while Agur is said in chapter 30:1 to be the son of Jakeh and
          some see a connection between him and the tribe of Ishmael (Gen.
          25:14).
          
           Solomon, a man of great wisdom and literature, was known
          throughout the earth (I Kings 4:29-34; Eccl. 12:9).  The writer's son
          (1:8, 2:1) is presumed to be Rehoboam who succeeded Solomon as
          King.  But the precepts are for all youths (4:1) and in the broadest
          scope for all men.

           The book of Proverbs seems to be comprised of at least two
          collections and perhaps three.  The second collection begins at 25:1
          which is said to have been copied out by Hezekiah's scribes (cf. 2
          Kings 18:37).  King Hezekiah lived more than 200 years after
          Solomon.  It is thought that these proverbs of Solomon may have
          been from a court collection used for teaching the princes and
          Hezekiah had them published for general use.  Thus the people got to
          train their children by royal text books.

           A proverb is a short pithy saying.  One definition said: Proverbs
          are short statements drawn from long experiences.  Of the 3,000
          proverbs which Solomon spoke, we have only those in this book and
          Ecclesiastes.  Of the 1,005 songs we have only those of the Song of
          Solomon.

           The use of proverbs have always been a favorite way of teaching. 
          They are quoted or alluded to some 32 times in the New Testament.
           The study of proverbs were an important part of a young man's
          education.  It is a vivid, practical, short, easy to remember saying of
          truth.  Henry Halley said, &quot;The Oriental method of teaching was
          constant repetition of wise and practical thoughts in a form that would
          stick in the mind.&quot;
          
           For example, chapter 31:10-31 is an acrostic ode on the worthy
          woman, laid out in a way easy to remember and repeat.

           The proverbs cover a host of subjects (cf. ch. 3 with ch. 22) 
          There is no clear continuity to the book.

          1)  The typical pattern is a couplet consisting of two short sentences
          which express a single thought.  The second line usually reinforces
          the first, as in Proverbs 22:1--
          
           &quot;A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches,
            And loving favour rather than silver and gold.
          
          2)  Another couplet pattern is where the second line states the
          opposite of the first, as in Proverbs 14:29.
          
           He that is slow to wrath has great understanding:
           But he that is impulsive exalts folly.
          
          3)  A third variation is where the second line or seceding lines
          complete the thought of the first, examples:
          
           The eyes of the Lord are in every place,
           Keeping watch on the evil and the good. 
                             Proverbs 15:3
          
           The fear of the Lord is to hate evil;
           Pride and arrogance and the evil way 
           And the perverse mouth I hate.
                             Proverbs 8:13

           The Book of Proverbs is a collection of inspired instructions on
          the kind of conduct which is desirable and acceptable before God. 
          The Proverbs teach piety, justice, and duty.  They deal in themes of
          morality, religion, society, and politics.  They draw comparisons
          between the righteous and the sinner, the wise and the foolish, and
          rewards and punishments.
          
           The books sets forth a system of morality which all men of good
          intentions, whether Hebrew or Gentiles, could appreciate and apply
          to daily life.  It must have been by deliberate design that the book
          contains nothing distinctive that marked it as being for Israel alone. 
          For example:
          
           1. There is no mention of Israel in the entire book.
           2. There is no allusion to the feast of the passover, or to the
                        feast of weeks, or to the feast of tabernacle.
           3. There is no mention of a sabbath day.
           4. There is no requirements or reference to the paying of tithes.
           5. There is no distinct trace of messianic hope.
          
           In its reference to God the book reflects the universal attributes
          of God's infinity, omnipresence, and that he chastens and reproves the
          faithful.  God is presented as rewarding the good and condemning the
          evil and is particularly concerned for the poor and lowly.
          
           It was a book that set forth a morality and conduct for men for all
          races and nations.  The book could be studied under the themes of
          Man's Obligations:
          
           1. His obligations to God,
           2. His obligations to Self,
           3. His obligations to Fellowmen,
           4. His obligations to Parents,
           5. His obligations to Spouse,
           6. His obligations to Children,
           7. His obligations to Civil Power.

              a.   Moses, at the end of his career as leader of the Israelites,
                             exhorted them:  &quot;And these words, which I command
                             thee this day, shall be in thine heart:&quot; (Deuteronomy
                             6:6) 
              b.   &quot;And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy
                             children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in
                             thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and
                             when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.&quot;
                             (Deuteronomy 6:7)
              c.   &quot;The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to
                             himself bringeth his mother to shame.&quot; (Proverbs
                             29:15)
